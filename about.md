My name is Bo and I'm a Senior TPM at LinkedIn. I graduated from the University of Waterloo in Spring 2018 with a Bachelor of Computer Science, Honours. 

I'm passionate about building great products, playing [Settlers of Catan](https://youtu.be/XwwiMc6rO-E?t=19), and living a happy, meaningful life.
