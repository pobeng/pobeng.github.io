I"Ô<p>I made the decision to study at Waterloo over 3 years ago, and I have no doubts it was the right decision. In this blog post, I will discuss the things that I love and hate about the University of Waterloo.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-love">What I love‚Ä¶</h2>

<h4 id="1-the-people-ive-met-and-the-experiences-ive-gained">1. The people I‚Äôve met and the experiences I‚Äôve gained</h4>

<p>Simply put, I‚Äôve met a lot of great people through my three years in Waterloo and co-op terms. The value of a university degree doesn‚Äôt come from the piece of paper I‚Äôll get when I graduate - it‚Äôs from the experiences I‚Äôve gained.</p>

<h4 id="2-invaluable-work-experience-through-6-co-op-terms">2. Invaluable work experience through 6 co-op terms</h4>

<p>Through my four co-op terms so far, I‚Äôve learned so much about the industry and developed real practical skills. Co-op is also a great opportunity to travel to different places, and only have to commit to an employer for 4 months.</p>

<h4 id="3-the-network-of-waterloo-students-staff-and-alumni">3. The network of Waterloo students, staff, and alumni</h4>

<p>If you put yourself out there, it‚Äôs very easy to meet like-minded individuals and build a personal network at Waterloo. A recent notable experience was hiking the Rocky Mountains in Colorado with a Waterloo Math lecturer!</p>

<h4 id="4-">4. $$$</h4>

<p>Because of co-op, I‚Äôll graduate university with zero debt. Having spoken to many students from American colleges, the cost of a Waterloo degree is comparatively cheap. Living expenses are also fairly low in Waterloo - you don‚Äôt have to pay over $1,200 a month to live on a couch!</p>

<h4 id="5-an-extra-year-to-figure-life-out">5. An extra year to figure life out</h4>

<p>Some people complain that our co-op programs take an extra year to complete, but it‚Äôs one of the things I appreciate the most. I‚Äôm still not mentally ready for graduation, so I‚Äôm cherishing every single moment of the extra year of being a college kid.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-hate">What I hate‚Ä¶</h2>

<h4 id="1-moving-every-4-months">1. Moving every 4 months</h4>

<p>The possibility of moving around every 4 months makes it hard to start or maintain friendships and relationships. There‚Äôs also the dilemma of being off-stream, where you basically never see another Waterloo student due to opposite co-op schedules. Other consequences of moving every four months include the lack of stability, no summer breaks, and the stress of having to find housing.</p>

<h4 id="2-the-huge-focus-on-academics-and-preparing-for-co-op">2. The huge focus on academics and preparing for co-op</h4>

<p>This is a consequence of having to cram tons of material in a 12 week term, and always having look for next term‚Äôs co-op placement. It‚Äôs not necessarily a bad thing to work really hard in life, but for many Waterloo students, it seems like they don‚Äôt have the opportunity to just ‚Äúchill out‚Äù and enjoy the college life.</p>

<h4 id="3-lack-of-continuity">3. Lack of continuity</h4>

<p>Once again, this occurs due to alternating academic and co-op terms. It‚Äôs difficult for student clubs and societies to run very well when people come and go every four months.</p>

<h4 id="4-lack-of-flexibility-in-academics">4. Lack of flexibility in academics</h4>

<p>This problem is prominent amongst engineering programs at Waterloo. I really wish I had the opportunity to take more diverse courses, but there‚Äôs not much flexibility. I really admire the students at Stanford, who have much greater flexibility and diversity of courses.</p>

<h4 id="5-cif">5. CIF</h4>

<p>This is a less serious complaint, but CIF (the main gym) is too crowded for my liking.</p>
