<p>Oh man, what an incredible year it‚Äôs been. These were just a few of many memories that I loved about 2017.</p>

<p>Back in February, I wrote a blog post about the <a href="below-the-iceberg-surface">iceberg illusion</a>. I was very proud of writing that post because it was the first time I openly discussed struggles that I was facing. In 2018, I wish to write more about challenging moments, so that my blog can be more relatable and personal.</p>

<h2 id="2018-goals">2018 Goals</h2>

<p>A year ago, I had set several <a href="/farewell-2016-hello-2017">goals</a> for my 2017 year. Though I‚Äôm pleased that I achieved most of them, I also realized that some of these goals didn‚Äôt really matter that much to me. For example, one goal that I described was ‚Äú<em>significantly reduce my use of plastic water bottles</em>‚Äù.</p>

<p>For 2018, I‚Äôm setting goals that are much simpler and more meaningful to me.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Be happy and healthy.</li>
  <li>Be brave and vulnerable.</li>
  <li>Maintain &amp; develop great relationships.</li>
  <li>Graduate.</li>
  <li>Get full-time job offer(s).</li>
  <li>Join the 1000lb club for squat/bench/deadlift total.</li>
</ul>

<p>I‚Äôm feeling quite bullish about 2018. I can‚Äôt wait for the new people and experiences 2018 will bring to my life!</p>
