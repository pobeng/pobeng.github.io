I"Ä<p>Itâ€™s 7:00am and right now Iâ€™m in the car leaving off to Waterloo. I will be living in a single room in Village 1. I will cover the topic of residences in a future post!</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been preparing myself for move in day for months now. Iâ€™m still astonished by how fast semester 2 and the summer went. Of course, there were some moments that went incredibly slow (cramming for Chemistry tests, procrastinating on English essays, preparing for interviews, etc.) I donâ€™t normally get this hyped for an event but this is the university life weâ€™re talking about. My expectations of Waterloo are probably way too high right now. Iâ€™m sure it wonâ€™t disappoint as long as I make an effort to enjoy it.</p>

<p>To be precise, my official move in day is tomorrow (September 1st) but I requested to move in earlier due to a scheduling conflict. I hope there will be at least one person in my residence today. Nevertheless, I am excited to meet everyone from my floor and building tomorrow. Iâ€™ll probably roam around Waterloo tonight and hang out with my friends.</p>

<p>Anyways, Iâ€™m almost at Waterloo. Itâ€™s going to be bittersweet saying goodbye to my parents in a few hours. Oh well, câ€™est la vie.</p>
