## 2017 Recap

- I was on 21 one-way flights, equivalent to my previous lifetime total.
- I [transferred from SE to CS](why-I-transfered-from-SE-to-CS). I will now graduate in August 2018, so I will begin job hunting in January or February. (Hello full-time friends who can help me out! ðŸ˜„)
- Made significant [strength and aesthetics progress](my-gym-transformation), including a 405lb deadlift PR!
- Secured a [co-op offer at LinkedIn](how-I-got-a-job-at-linkedin-by-using-linkedin), and the opportunity to return to my favourite place in the world: New York City. ðŸ—½
- Had a great time at [CUSEC 2017](http://2017.cusec.net/) in Montreal.
- An awesome [internship at Axon](unforgettable-summer-internship-at-axon). The summer weather in Seattle is spectacular.
- [Rode along with police officers](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6339532432571797504) across the US and watched them use lackluster software solutions.
- Flew to Hollywood and learned about how the industry works there.
- Went on the [best trip of my life](axon-grand-canyon-trip-2017) to date. Spent a week rafting and camping along the Colorado River, and then hiked out of the Grand Canyon.
- Discovered how amazing the Bose QC 35 Wireless Headphones were -- they literally changed my life.
- Finally stopped procrastinating and kicked off the [Canada new grad offer survey](https://goo.gl/forms/EtBFEGbNlrdcyqzx2). I will publish a blog post describing the results on January 5th.
- Turned 21 a few weeks ago, finally legal in America!

Oh man, what an incredible year it's been. These were just a few of many memories that I loved about 2017.

Back in February, I wrote a blog post about the [iceberg illusion](below-the-iceberg-surface). I was very proud of writing that post because it was the first time I openly discussed struggles that I was facing. In 2018, I wish to write more about challenging moments, so that my blog can be more relatable and personal.

## 2018 Goals

A year ago, I had set several [goals](/farewell-2016-hello-2017) for my 2017 year. Though I'm pleased that I achieved most of them, I also realized that some of these goals didn't really matter that much to me. For example, one goal that I described was "*significantly reduce my use of plastic water bottles*".

For 2018, I'm setting goals that are much simpler and more meaningful to me.

- Be happy and healthy.
- Be brave and vulnerable.
- Maintain & develop great relationships.
- Graduate.
- Get full-time job offer(s).
- Join the 1000lb club for squat/bench/deadlift total.

I'm feeling quite bullish about 2018. I can't wait for the new people and experiences 2018 will bring to my life!
