Hey everyone! My name is Bo Peng and I’m a first-year Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I’ll be blogging about my experiences (both good and bad) here. I’ll also post some informational stuff for you keen high schoolers wanting to apply to university.

I better get back to packing now… Move in day is tomorrow!
