I made the decision to study at Waterloo over 3 years ago, and I have no doubts it was the right decision. In this blog post, I will discuss the things that I love and hate about the University of Waterloo.

## What I love...

#### 1. The people I've met and the experiences I've gained

Simply put, I've met a lot of great people through my three years in Waterloo and co-op terms. The value of a university degree doesn't come from the piece of paper I'll get when I graduate - it's from the experiences I've gained.

#### 2. Invaluable work experience through 6 co-op terms

Through my four co-op terms so far, I've learned so much about the industry and developed real practical skills. Co-op is also a great opportunity to travel to different places, and only have to commit to an employer for 4 months.

#### 3. The network of Waterloo students, staff, and alumni

If you put yourself out there, it's very easy to meet like-minded individuals and build a personal network at Waterloo. A recent notable experience was hiking the Rocky Mountains in Colorado with a Waterloo Math lecturer!

#### 4. $$$

Because of co-op, I'll graduate university with zero debt. Having spoken to many students from American colleges, the cost of a Waterloo degree is comparatively cheap. Living expenses are also fairly low in Waterloo - you don't have to pay over $1,200 a month to live on a couch!

#### 5. An extra year to figure life out

Some people complain that our co-op programs take an extra year to complete, but it's one of the things I appreciate the most. I'm still not mentally ready for graduation, so I'm cherishing every single moment of the extra year of being a college kid.


## What I hate...

#### 1. Moving every 4 months

The possibility of moving around every 4 months makes it hard to start or maintain friendships and relationships. There's also the dilemma of being off-stream, where you basically never see another Waterloo student due to opposite co-op schedules. Other consequences of moving every four months include the lack of stability, no summer breaks, and the stress of having to find housing.

#### 2. The huge focus on academics and preparing for co-op

This is a consequence of having to cram tons of material in a 12 week term, and always having look for next term's co-op placement. It's not necessarily a bad thing to work really hard in life, but for many Waterloo students, it seems like they don't have the opportunity to just "chill out" and enjoy the college life.

#### 3. Lack of continuity

Once again, this occurs due to alternating academic and co-op terms. It's difficult for student clubs and societies to run very well when people come and go every four months.

#### 4. Lack of flexibility in academics

This problem is prominent amongst engineering programs at Waterloo. I really wish I had the opportunity to take more diverse courses, but there's not much flexibility. I really admire the students at Stanford, who have much greater flexibility and diversity of courses.

#### 5. CIF

This is a less serious complaint, but CIF (the main gym) is too crowded for my liking.
