It’s 7:00am and right now I’m in the car leaving off to Waterloo. I will be living in a single room in Village 1. I will cover the topic of residences in a future post!

I’ve been preparing myself for move in day for months now. I’m still astonished by how fast semester 2 and the summer went. Of course, there were some moments that went incredibly slow (cramming for Chemistry tests, procrastinating on English essays, preparing for interviews, etc.) I don’t normally get this hyped for an event but this is the university life we’re talking about. My expectations of Waterloo are probably way too high right now. I’m sure it won’t disappoint as long as I make an effort to enjoy it.

To be precise, my official move in day is tomorrow (September 1st) but I requested to move in earlier due to a scheduling conflict. I hope there will be at least one person in my residence today. Nevertheless, I am excited to meet everyone from my floor and building tomorrow. I’ll probably roam around Waterloo tonight and hang out with my friends.

Anyways, I’m almost at Waterloo. It’s going to be bittersweet saying goodbye to my parents in a few hours. Oh well, c’est la vie.
