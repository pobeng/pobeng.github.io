**Tuesday March 7:** After a long journey, I am pleased to announce that I'll be working at Axon/Taser in Seattle for the summer. Super excited about the "internal startup" team I'll be joining. Also pumped to be helping build an awesome product that helps police officers spend more time in the field, rather than the office.

**Monday March 6:** Lab. Rankings closes today on WaterlooWorks. Students will find out their matches tomorrow.

**Sunday March 5:** Lab.

**Saturday March 4:** Lab. Can just fast-forward to Tuesday.

**Friday March 3:** Basically going to spend my weekend doing the OS lab and contemplating about what to do in life.

**Thursday March 2:** 1 more day.

**Wednesday March 1:** Did well on my interview for company F today, let's see what's next. 2 more days until ranking day...

**Tuesday February 28:** Things are wrapping up soon. Fun times. To be honest, I'm beginning to have some doubts in myself. However, I'm pretty sure I did well on the interviews, so I'm still quite confident and optimistic about my chances.

**Monday February 27:** Confirmed that company F interview will be on Wednesday. 4 more days until ranking day... Exciting times.

**Sunday February 26:** 5 more days until ranking day...

**Saturday February 25:** The next week sure will be exciting! It's going to be down to the wire again.

**Friday February 24:** Sent another follow up email to Company D. Got a response from the COO, saying he liked my written challenge; however, cannot hire me right now, as they're trying to hire a senior person to spearhead the Product org. I got a new interview through WaterlooWorks for a company in SF. The interview is next Wednesday.

**Thursday February 23:** Still waiting to hear back from those two places. Seems like Company D is unresponsive to me now (the one I did the written challenge for).

**Wednesday February 22:** No updates today.

**Tuesday February 21:** Round 4 interview with Company A went well. Let's see what the next steps are.

**Monday February 20:** I was wrong about no responses today. Company A contacted me for round 4 of interviews. Sent over my availabilities. Hopefully, this should be the last one.

**Sunday February 19:** Again, just a chill day. I don't expect any response tomorrow because it's a holiday in the US.

**Saturday February 18:** Beginning of reading week, taking my mind off of everything for this weekend.

**Friday February 17:** Did my interview with company A today, went very well. Still waiting for company E, seems like they didn't send out any new offers today.

**Thursday February 16:** Spoke with the recruiter from company A about next steps and logistics. Have another interview with a director tomorrow. Still awaiting company E's decision, it seems like they're sending offers on rolling basis.

**Wednesday February 15:** Waiting is tough.

**Tuesday February 14:** Seems like my previous theory was false. Still waiting patiently!

**Monday February 13:** Happy Valentine's Day eve. Hoping to get matched with a desired job in a few weeks. The recruiter from company A also emailed me to set up some time to chat. An excited version of me would believe this is an offer, but can't count your eggs before they hatch.

**Sunday February 12:** I've been thinking about a theory related to the generic email sent out by company E on Friday. Let's see if it proves to be true.

**Saturday February 11:** Just watched Netflix today.

**Friday February 10:** No updates today. However, later in the day, a generic email was sent out from company E to certain people. I did not get it. I wonder what this means.

**Thursday February 9:** Got my onsite interview revoked for company C because they are cancelling their internship program. Found some time to work on the challenge assigned from company D. Let's see how this goes. This has been a pretty bad week overall.

**Wednesday February 8:** Quiet day. Crickets chirp.

**Tuesday February 7:** I think I did pretty well for round 2 interview of company A today. Anyways, WaterlooWorks apps are screening quite slow. Unfortunately, for company B, my hopes are dead due to an executive level headcount planning.

**Monday February 6:** My round 2 interview for company A got rescheduled to tomorrow. I also got notified that I am moving on to the onsite round for company C. Going to fly to SF some time during reading week!

**Sunday February 5:** Was stuck in the lab the entire day yesterday.

**Saturday February 4:** Tried to work on the case study challenge, but couldn't really focus today.

**Friday February 3:** Had my interview with company D today, and it went well. The interviewer gave me a take-home deliverable to do, so I'll probably work on it this weekend. My round 2 interview with company C went very well.

**Thursday February 2:** WaterlooWorks has been pretty quiet this week, no new interviews. I was notified that I'm moving on to round 2 with company A.

**Wednesday February 1:** Oh man, today's interview with company E was hard and thought provoking. Good experience, let's see if I get an offer.

**Tuesday January 31:** Received an email from company D. Setting up a phone call with the COO later this week. I was able to switch my interview for company E from Japan to HQ, and the interview is tomorrow! I also heard back from company C, who I interviewed with yesterday. I'm proceeding to the second round and my interview is this Friday. Had my phone interview with a recruiter from company B, was really nice talking with her. Hopefully, I move on to the 2nd round, as this company is in my top 2.

**Monday January 30:** Did my interview with company C today. It was just the initial phone screen with a recruiter, nothing particularly challenging as expected. The interview process for this role would be an additional phone interview and then onsite in SF. I'm awaiting a few email responses today. My top choice responded back to me to schedule last Friday's interview for tomorrow.

**Sunday January 29:** Didn't have time to prepare for interviews today, was busy working on assignments. This is going to be one exciting week, let's see how it goes. :)

**Saturday January 28:** Awaiting email responses from a few places with respect to scheduling. Today's just a catch up on homework day.

**Friday January 27:** Typing this as I'm waiting for my interviewer from company B to call me, they are currently 20 minutes late. Things like this happen from time to time, so after 10 mins of waiting, I sent them a follow-up email. On the other hand, as I was waiting, I received an interview from WaterlooWorks for a job in Japan! Let's call this company E. This is quite exciting. Update: the interviewer for company B replied that a meeting ran over, so my interview was rescheduled to Tuesday.

**Thursday January 26:** Had my first interview today with company A, I think I performed very well. Earlier this morning, WaterlooWorks rolled back to an earlier state. This basically meant anybody who got rejected or selected now is rolled back to the default "applied" status. The release of WaterlooWorks has been quite underachieving. Got another interview from an external application, woot! Let's call this company C, they're based in SF. Wow, got another response from a company (D) in Toronto that I cold emailed. Let's see how that goes.

**Wednesday January 25:** Quiet day. No changes in applications. Attempted to prepare for tomorrow's interview.

**Tuesday January 24:** WaterlooWorks applications closed today, so now it's a waiting game for employers to scan through the resumes. I know some companies like Shopify and Google go through resumes in batches on the first day. Today, I screwed up. I thought I had an interview on Thursday for an external company (A), but realized it was actually today, after the interviewer called me. I acknowledged my mistake and asked to postpone the interview. Thankfully, the request was accepted, and now it's actually on Thursday. A referral I received for a big company (B) in SF got back to me, and now I have a call with the recruiter on Friday. Let's see how that goes!

**Monday January 23:** Submitted my applications on WaterlooWorks. The deadline is tomorrow at 9:00AM, which is different from past terms where it was 11:59PM. I have a strong feeling there will be people who forget to apply due to this reason. Always apply earlier, and never save things right before the deadline!

**Sunday January 22:** I've been submitting several applications externally for the past couple of weeks. I've also been asking upper year friends for referrals to companies and also tried cold calling people on LinkedIn/email.
