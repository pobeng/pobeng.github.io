  <p>I‚Äôve been lifting for 1.5 years now, and it‚Äôs become one of the best investments in my life. In this blog post, I‚Äôll share the 9 most important lessons that I learned.</p>

<p>I previously wrote a <a href="/my-gym-transformation">blog post</a> about my gym journey. What I‚Äôve come to realize was that my biggest transformation wasn‚Äôt physical, but rather mental.</p>

<h2 id="1-mental-confidence">1. Mental confidence.</h2>

<p>If I don‚Äôt believe I can lift a weight, then I probably can‚Äôt lift it. Before I attempt my heavy lifts, I always try to visualize myself doing the set and replaying that picture in my head. I‚Äôve been able to transfer this skill into many other aspects of my life, where I try to mentally visualize success.</p>

<p>When I first started lifting, I had a bunch of thoughts in my head that might sound familiar to all gym goers. <em>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to lift. I‚Äôm scared. I‚Äôm so weak. People are going to judge me.‚Äù</em> Now that I‚Äôve conquered this fear with lifting, I‚Äôve become less scared to try new things. For example, I‚Äôve always been terrified of dancing, but last week I tried salsa dancing for the first time. I didn‚Äôt care what people thought about me and I had a great time at the event.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/17ceu6/what_makes_squats_so_great/c84ag4n/">my favourite quote</a> about lifting:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That weight when squatting isn‚Äôt pressure. It‚Äôs adversity. Remember that feeling. Hold it, picture it, grasp it, bottle it. That fear is you pushing yourself way you of your comfort zone. You‚Äôll get that same fear doing anything worth doing. Anything that‚Äôs intimidating and challenging. When you squat you are transcending your adversity and fears. The weight is all of your doubts and fear manifested into a barbell and some weights. When you squat, you‚Äôre praying. For the strength and willpower the transcend your limits, for the ability to rise and get back up.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="2-think-long-term">2. Think long-term.</h2>

<p>When I squatted for the first time, I was whobbly with the 45lb bar. Now, I can squat 315lbs for 5 reps. During this journey, there were times where I was lifting with my <em>ego</em>, and tried to go for unnecessary short-term personal records. This sometimes resulted in stalling, or even injuries. With an injury, your one month of good progress might suddenly become two months backwards in progress.</p>

<p>While I still do celebrate small short-term victories every now and then, it‚Äôs the long-term mentality that I value the most. Assuming a steady and injury-free progress, I‚Äôll be a heck lot stronger in a year from now than I am today.</p>

<h2 id="3-time-management">3. Time management.</h2>

<p>I spend about 10 hours a week lifting and commuting to and from the gym. Although it‚Äôs a large time investment, I‚Äôve actually gained more productive time by being better at managing my time. I usually go to the gym in the mornings, so this forces me to sleep early and wake up early. During busy weeks, I make sure I focus on getting my work done, so I never have to skip a gym day.</p>

<h2 id="4-progress-is-non-linear">4. Progress is non-linear.</h2>

<p>In my first few months, I experienced the phenomenon called ‚Äòbeginner gains‚Äô, where I went up 5 lbs on my lifts every workout. Gaining strength is a lot harder to come by now.</p>

<p>In terms of my physical appearance, it changed quite a bit month-over-month in the first 9 months. After that phase, monthly changes were less noticeable. For anyone that wants to get started with lifting, the good news is that you can achieve a great physical transformation in under a year.</p>

<p>Over a 10-20 year scale, I believe strength progress should be logarithmic.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="5-train-smart-not-hard">5. Train smart, not hard.</h2>

<p>Strength progress is not directly proportional to the amount of effort you spend training. You should come prepared with a plan that includes progressive overloading, and sick to the plan. Don‚Äôt be that person who goes to the gym, does random lifts, and makes no progress over months.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve also learned that more days of training doesn‚Äôt necessarily result in better progress than less days of training, i.e. 6 days vs 4 days. It‚Äôs possible to overtrain, which negatively affects your progress by not getting enough rest.</p>

<h2 id="6-focus-on-one-thing">6. Focus on one thing.</h2>

<p><em>‚ÄúI want to gain strength, be lean, and build muscle.‚Äù</em> While it‚Äôs not impossible to achieve that statement, it‚Äôs definitely very difficult to achieve naturally. Instead of trying to achieve everything, I would recommend to just stick with one thing. For months, I was running a program that promoted both powerlifting and bodybuilding. Though I did get a bit of strength, and some size, I felt like it wasn‚Äôt ideal for progress overall. After I switched to a program that focused exclusively on strength, I increased my squat by 45lbs in 10 weeks.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="7-lifting-is-only-20-of-the-work">7. Lifting is only 20% of the work.</h2>

<p>The remaining 80% comes from proper dieting, staying consistent, getting enough rest, and training smart. If you lift and don‚Äôt eat well, you won‚Äôt get great progress. If you‚Äôre trying to lose weight and don‚Äôt change your eating habits, you won‚Äôt get far.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Abs are made in the kitchen, not the gym.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="8-social-environment">8. Social environment.</h2>

<p>By design, the gym is a community of people that share similar interests. It‚Äôs a great way to make friends. If you‚Äôre ever looking to make new friends or bond with existing friends, the gym is an awesome place to go to.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="9-be-obsessed">9. Be obsessed.</h2>

<p>This lesson doesn‚Äôt apply to everyone. Since discovering powerlifting, I‚Äôve become obsessed with it. I want to constantly improve myself in all aspects. I record my workout videos, and watch them to see where I can improve my form. I preach lifting to my friends and co-workers. I‚Äôve written two blog posts about lifting. You get the point. Whether this obsession is positive or negative, I‚Äôm genuinely happy to have discovered something that makes me so passionate. üòÑ</p>
