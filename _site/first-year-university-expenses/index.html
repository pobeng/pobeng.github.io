<p><strong>University is an exciting experience, but it sure doesn’t come cheap.</strong></p>

<p><img src="/assets/tuition.png" alt="Tuition Cover" /></p>

<h2 id="1-tuition">1. Tuition</h2>

<p>Tuition is easily the largest incurred expense. The costs varies across programs, schools, and location in Canada. The average undergraduate tuition increases by about 3% each year for domestic students and 6% for international students.</p>

<p>I’ve compiled a spreadsheet of undergraduate tuition costs (thanks to Stats Canada). These numbers give you a pretty accurate amount that you should expect to pay. All of these numbers assume you are a domestic student enrolled in a full course load. International students should expect to pay between $20,000 to $40,000 for tuition per year.</p>

<p>Programs like arts, humanities and science are regulated, which means all schools in Ontario charge a similar amount of $6,000 - $6,500. Engineering, math and computer science programs should be very close as well, though some schools attract higher fees. For example, York Engineering charges $8,800, whereas Waterloo &amp; U of T Engineering charges about $13,000 (the average in Ontario is $10,500).</p>

<p>Professional programs such as business and accounting are not regulated, so their costs vary greatly. I’ve compiled the cost for ten popular programs.</p>

<h2 id="2-other-academic-fees">2. Other Academic Fees</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>View other academic fees spreadsheet here: <a href="https://goo.gl/NTUwA8">https://goo.gl/NTUwA8</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This category includes non-tuition fees such as textbooks, student societies, endowment funds, orientation week, building fees, student service fees, health and dental coverage, co-op fees, etc. The majority of these fees are <strong>mandatory.</strong> Some fees are refundable, but students don’t usually opt out because 1) they think it’s for a good cause or 2) it takes too much work to get a refund.</p>

<p>My total ‘Other Academic’ fees is about $1,170 per term, or $2,340 per year. A large portion of this price comes from the co-op program fee. Generally, students in regular programs should expect to pay about $1,000 to $1,500 per year for <em>other academic</em> fees.</p>

<h2 id="3-residence">3. Residence</h2>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Depending on your situation, this category could cost or save you a lot of money. For my first year, I lived in a single room at Village One residence at a monthly cost of about $740. I also was required to purchase a meal plan. In general, residences are more expensive than living off-campus. However, I would recommend living in residence for your first year to have an easier time adjusting to university and meeting new people.</p>

<p>The other option is to save some money and live off-campus. Some places are quite far, so you might have to commute to school. You can either sign a one year lease or sublet from someone else for four months. I would say the average place costs about $500-600 per month.</p>

<p>If it’s possible, you can always live at home with your family. It’s economical and comfortable.</p>

<h2 id="4-food">4. Food</h2>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Food costs vary greatly depending on your eating and cooking habits. At traditional residences, you are required to purchase a meal plan, which costs $2,000+ per term. That’s $500/month already! You’re also going to get sick of eating the cafeteria food everyday, so you’ll most likely eat out a few times per week. That could run you another $100-200 per month, if not more. When I stayed at residence, I spent $700-900 per month on food (including the meal plan).</p>

<p>Another option is to cook! People who buys groceries and cook their own meals spend only about $150 to $250 per month on food. Eating out from time to time will increase this number to $300 per month.</p>

<p>The most economical option is eating at your family’s home. You can virtually spend $0 if you’re very conservative. Buying food now and then will only cost you about $50 per month.</p>

<p>The least economical option is to eat out for every single meal. This can easily run you $700+ per month. I personally fall into this category. I tracked my all of my food expenses (includes going out with friends, coffee, etc.) for a month. Surprisingly, I spent <em>only</em> $463 in June.</p>

<h2 id="5-entertainment">5. Entertainment</h2>

<p>This category includes anything from watching a movie, gym membership, buying others gifts, partying, etc. It is difficult to track this expense, but I would say I spend $50 a month on entertainment. Unless you’re spending well over $100/month, this category shouldn’t affect your total budget much.</p>

<h2 id="6-travel">6. Travel</h2>

<p>Travel expenses include gas &amp; insurance, bus pass, carpooling, and airplane tickets. I’m fortunate in the sense that I’m from the GTA and don’t have to spend much on travel expenses. I go back home once a month, which costs about $20 round trip. Waterloo students also get ‘free’ bus passes, so I never have to pay for local bus rides.</p>

<p>Some students may have to spend a significant amount on flying, whether it’s  domestic or international. Some students have to commute to school every day. For example, a TTC monthly pass costs about $100 for U of T students. That’s $800 over an academic year!</p>

<h2 id="7-examples">7. Examples</h2>

</blockquote>

<p>To get a complete picture of how much year actually costs, I’ve compiled a list of real students’ expenses. The participating students are from a variety of programs, lifestyles, and spending habits. In addition, I’ve anonymized their names. My total expenses from September 2014 to April 2015 was just over $27,000.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed this blog post, see you next time!</p>
