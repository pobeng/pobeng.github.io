        Waterloo Open House Fall 2014

    <time datetime="2014-11-01T00:00:00-04:00" class="post-date">01 Nov 2014</time>

    <p>An estimated total of over 11,000 people attended Waterloo’s Fall Open House 2014. This represents a new record, and it just astonishes me how much Waterloo grows every single year. I volunteered for the entire day as the department lead ambassador for Software Engineering, so it’s very likely that I met many of my readers in person.</p>

<p>I remember how one year ago, I was the person asking the volunteers questions. Times have changed, and now I’m the  one who answers these questions and share my experience at Waterloo. I really enjoyed meeting so many passionate students and sharing my personal stories with them. Andrew Morton, the director of the Software Engineering program, gave a very informational presentation about our program.</p>

<p>Although the room was always packed and boiling hot, each person learned something new about our program and had their questions addressed. At the end of every presentation, a few upper-year students and I would hold an open question and answer session for the whole crowd. I think having the current students talk about their experiences and answering the questions was a great supplement to the presentation.</p>

<p>Anyways, thanks to everyone who came out today! The Fall Open House was a huge success!</p>
