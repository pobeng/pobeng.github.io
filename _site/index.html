      <p><strong>What a difference a year makes.</strong></p>

<p><img src="/assets/enactus-cover.png" alt="Enactus Cover" />
One year ago today I was counting down the days until high school graduation. Suffering from boredom and “senioritis”, I did my usual thing and scrolled through Facebook, hoping to find something remotely interesting. Fifteen minutes later, I managed to come across this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPW25D0WQy8">video.</a></p>

<p>In my opinion, this is the most important rule in life. Some people may know this phrase as the Golden Rule: <strong>“Treat others how you’d like to be treated.”</strong> There’s a good reason why this expression appears everywhere, whether it’s your parents teaching you about manners, or as seen in religious texts. Respect others and be considerate.</p>

<p>This is actually the easiest lesson to follow, but it astonishes me how many people in this world don’t know the meaning of respect. I plead for you to praise this rule because nobody wants to work with a disrespectful individual in academic or professional environments. <em>Hint</em> In job interviews, employers assess both your technical skills and fit with the company culture. For example, you could be the best software developer in the world, but if the employer doesn’t want to work with you, then you’re not getting the job.</p>

<p>Today, I’ll be going over my experience applying to my first co-op job and providing tips to maximize your chances. This blog post will be tailored towards engineering and math students, though students of all faculties can benefit from reading this post.</p>

      <p>For most programs at Waterloo, it is strongly recommended to fill out the admission information form (AIF). By the end of this post, you guys will learn how the AIF may be the difference between an offer and rejection.</p>
