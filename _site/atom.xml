   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In this post, I write about tips for getting into University of Waterloo’s Engineering programs. It also features insights from the Director of Waterloo Engineering Admissions and recently admitted students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/waterlooeng.png&quot; alt=&quot;How to get into Waterloo Engineering&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;February 19, 2014.&lt;/em&gt; I vividly remember the day I was admitted into University of Waterloo’s Software Engineering program. I screamed in excitement, spun in my chair, and repeatedly jumped up and down. I told my parents and they were obviously ecstatic to hear the news. It was a moment that I won’t ever forget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four years ago, I wrote a post on &lt;a href=&quot;/how-to-write-a-great-aif&quot;&gt;how to write a great AIF&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, hundreds of students have thanked me for writing the post, whether in person or online. Now that I’ve graduated, I wanted to give back to the community one last time. I want to help other people experience that memorable moment I experienced four years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post would not be possible without &lt;a href=&quot;https://profbillanderson.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Professor Bill Anderson&lt;/a&gt;, the Director of Waterloo Engineering Admissions. Please note that the contents of this post is referring to Waterloo Engineering admissions, and may not be applicable to other faculties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;admissions-criteria&quot;&gt;Admissions Criteria&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each applicant will have an admission score. This is the sum of the admission average + AIF score + adjustment factor + video interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Admission average&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The admission average is your top 6 courses, which include English, Advanced Functions, Calculus, Chemistry, Physics, and one other course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the most important factor, as you can objectively control this score. However, for the most competitive programs, a 96% average yields about a &lt;a href=&quot;https://theroadtoengineering.com/2018/09/06/chances-of-admission-for-fall-2019/&quot;&gt;40% chance&lt;/a&gt; of getting in. Please note that probability for the 98% to 100% range was a result of the mathematical model to fit the curve, so it doesn’t represent a real reduction in probability of admission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/averagechart.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. AIF score&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The admission information form (AIF) is worth up to 5 points. You’ll have the opportunity to brag about all your accomplishments and future aspirations here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most students overestimate their AIF score. According to Professor Anderson, the majority of applicants score in the 1-2 range. Scores of 4 and 5 are reserved for applicants with highly distinguished accomplishments in the national and international ranks. They make up less than 10-15% of all applicants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Adjustment factor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://profbillanderson.wordpress.com/2017/09/17/admissions-2018-how-its-going-to-work/&quot;&gt;adjustment factor&lt;/a&gt; is the difference between the first year engineering average and the admission average, grouped by school or region. The adjustment factor is only used when there is a sufficient amount of data points from the specific school or region for the past 6 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://globalnews.ca/news/4405495/waterloo-engineering-grade-inflation-list/&quot;&gt;Global News article&lt;/a&gt; featured Waterloo Engineering’s adjustment factor tool used for admissions. The full spreadsheet can be found here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aj9k8iaBgWYREcT6vtiKAFV8X8aTYtN7fdxHlLbSioA/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;Waterloo Engineering adjustment factor&lt;/a&gt;. Full credit to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Cain&quot;&gt;Patrick Cain&lt;/a&gt; from Global News.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average adjustment factor is 16%. We observe that there are schools in the range of 10% to 13%, which represent a pretty significant advantage. There are also a few schools with adjustment factors above 20%, which negatively impact those students’ chances. This concept is also applied to provinces and international applicants. New Brunswick students had adjustment factors of 26% versus Quebec CEGEP grads who had adjustment factors of 5%. If an Ontario school isn’t on the list, it means there isn’t sufficient data points and that the adjustment factor is 16%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This concept may be considered controversial because it’s heavily weighted and it’s not a factor that students can control. This means that not all schools are considered equal. According to Waterloo Engineering, over &lt;a href=&quot;https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering/future-undergraduate-students/application-process/ranking-high-schools&quot;&gt;90% of high schools are not adjusted&lt;/a&gt;, i.e. the adjustment factor is 16%. However, for schools on either end of the spectrum, there exists a significant gap. To put it into perspective, I will use the North York region as an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/northyork.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Adjustment factors for North York. Credit: Patrick Cain from Global News&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I attended Northview Heights SS which has an adjustment factor of 10.1%. This represents a 5.9% advantage over the average adjustment factor of 16%. If I had a 91% average at Northview, then I might be considered a stronger applicant than someone with a 95% average at a school with the average adjustment factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Northview applicant’s net score: 91 - 10.1 = &lt;strong&gt;80.9&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; Other applicant’s net score: 95 - 16 = &lt;strong&gt;79.0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, George S Henry Academy has an adjustment factor of 22.4%, which is a 6.4% disadvantage. Similarly, this means a student with a 95% average at George S Henry Academy has worse chances than someone with a 91% average at a school with the average adjustment factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GSHA applicant’s net score: 95 - 22.4 = &lt;strong&gt;72.6&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; Other applicant’s net score: 91 - 16 = &lt;strong&gt;75.0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor Anderson also says “We may also make adjustments for unusually high grades in required courses taken outside of a regular day school, such as at summer, night or private school.” Their reasoning can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://profbillanderson.wordpress.com/2014/10/05/back-to-summer-school/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, so I would recommend taking required courses in only your regular day school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Video interview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a new, optional component of the admission process for Waterloo Engineering, worth up to 3 additional points. It resembles a future co-op interview, where you try to sell your personal goals and interests to the Waterloo admission team. The average score is 2, and very few people score 3’s. Professor Anderson mentioned that an applicant with a 3 point response can clearly communicate their motivation and future aspirations to the evaluator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-admissions-work&quot;&gt;How Admissions Work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a high-level description of how admissions work. In reality, there are many more complexities and nuances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each program, the admissions team will sort the applicants in descending order of their admission score. The applicants who have amongst the highest scores will probably receive an offer. After the majority of offers are allocated, there will eventually be a point where applicants are only separated by a small margin, i.e., 1%. At this point, the admissions team might handpick the applicants, since their scores are so close to each other. The AIF will become a strong deciding factor in this situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve constructed a hypothetical case to help readers visualize the admission process. Let’s assume there are ten applicants for the Software Engineering (SE) program and only four allocated spots in the program. The admissions team will send out more offers than targeted spots, as not every student will accept their offer. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://patricklam.ca/se-board-2018/report/SE_Board_20180522-slides.pdf&quot;&gt;SE program&lt;/a&gt; usually sends out 1.5x more offers than allocated spots. To fill four spots, the admissions team would likely send out six offers, which represents a targeted acceptance rate of 66.7%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Figure 1, there are 10 made up applicants listed with their admission average, AIF score, adjustment factor, and video interview score.  The overall admission score is the sum of these four factors. Note that the applicants are ordered by descending admission averages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/admissiontable1.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Figure 1: Applicants ordered by descending admissions average&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Figure 2, the applicants are sorted in descending order of their overall admission score. Applicants B, C, and D all had amongst the strongest overall scores, so they will each receive an offer. Although Applicant J only had an 89% admission average, they benefited greatly from the adjustment factor of 5% (CEGEP grad from Quebec).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/admissiontable2.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Figure 2: Applicants ordered by descending overall score&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we have two more offers to send out, and there are four applicants with an 83 or 84 overall score. For the final spots, the admission team will likely handpick the applicants, since the margin is so small. Applicant A has an amazing 99% admission average, but is weighed down by their school’s poor adjustment factor. Applicant E has a pretty strong case as well. Applicant F has a solid average, and a great AIF. Applicant H has a lower average, but received perfect scores in the AIF and video interview, which is quite rare. In this scenario, all four of these applicants are suitable picks. The admissions team might end up giving offers to Applicant F and H due to their strong AIF scores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of the admissions team is to attract top talent to Waterloo and hopefully watch them graduate. In an ideal world, 100% of first year engineering students will graduate from the University of Waterloo in their admitted program and on time. However, this is far from reality. University is arguably more difficult than high school, so some students will fail in academics. Students may also discover that the program they chose was not the right fit for them, and end up pivoting to something else. The admissions team seek these two factors from applicants: a high likelihood to succeed academically and a genuine interest in the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first factor, high grades in AP or IB courses or at “good” schools are convincing reasons to demonstrate potential success in university academics. For the second factor, the admissions team want applicants who can clearly articulate their passions for their specific engineering program. The admissions team wouldn’t want to admit someone who fails to demonstrate interest in their program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;timeline&quot;&gt;Timeline&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application process isn’t just a 6 month process, but rather a multi-year process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pre-high-school&quot;&gt;Pre High School&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process begins with parents choosing the right high school for their child. As mentioned earlier, there is an adjustment factor that rewards students from “good” high schools and penalizes students from “less good” high schools. Although this can definitely make a difference in admission decisions, the more important factor is nurturing the child in an environment where they can be happy and succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;grade-9--10&quot;&gt;Grade 9 &amp;amp; 10&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grade 9 and 10 marks don’t affect your chances for admission. Your goal should be to get decent marks, build up a strong academic base, and then rev up the engine for your grade 11 and 12 marks. You should get involved with a few extracurriculars and then eventually narrow
down to one or two that you’re super passionate about. For extracurriculars, depth (quality) is better than breadth (quantity).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;grade-11&quot;&gt;Grade 11&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, by grade 11, you should have a better sense of what you want to do in the future. If you don’t know, that’s totally fine. Personally, I think it’s a bit ridiculous that society expects us to know what we want at age 16!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be wise to take some grade 12 courses while you’re in grade 11. I personally took advanced functions (MHF4U) and CS (ICS4U) in my 2nd semester of grade 11. It was a great decision because I could focus my time on those two courses in an easier grade 11 workload.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For extracurriculars, you should be heavily involved in one or two things. Hopefully, your involvement can yield recognizable accomplishments. Getting some work or volunteer experience in your desired field would also look fantastic on your AIF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;grade-12&quot;&gt;Grade 12&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In grade 12, your top priority should be to get high grades in your required courses. Your second priority is crafting a great AIF with all of the experiences you’ve gathered in previous years. If you don’t have many experiences, that’s fine as well—-focus on selling your potential, i.e., your passions and aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;september-november&quot;&gt;September-November&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;University fairs and campus tours usually take place in September to November. During this time period, you should expect to receive instructions on how to apply to post-secondary schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;december-january&quot;&gt;December-January&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should be working on your AIF and perfecting it. Submitting it before February is highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;february-march&quot;&gt;February-March&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late-February, Waterloo Engineering has an &lt;a href=&quot;https://profbillanderson.wordpress.com/2018/02/27/a-few-offers-so-far/&quot;&gt;early round&lt;/a&gt; of admissions, where they give offers to fill up about 25% of available space. Students who receive early offers must have at least three grade 12 required courses completed, and typically have consistently high grade 11 and 12 marks. Professor Anderson says that “it takes us until mid-April to complete all the AIF and interview scoring, so at this stage it’s somewhat random whether those play a significant role or not for any one individual.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, grade 11 marks do play a role in early admission. However, not getting an early offer isn’t the end of the world, as the majority of offers are handed out in May. I believe the purpose of early offers is to attract top-performing students to the in-person
March Break open house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early offers for applicants outside of Ontario high schools are on a rolling basis, rather than all coming out at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;april&quot;&gt;April&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Midterm marks in the 2nd semester are considered for the May round of admission offers, so applicants have one last opportunity to improve their chances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;may&quot;&gt;May&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final decision is given in May: offer, alternate offer, or no offer. Scholarship decisions are also made during this time based on your overall admission score and AIF. Some entrance scholarships can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://uwaterloo.ca/undergraduate-entrance-awards/awards/search-results?level=All&amp;amp;type=55&amp;amp;process=All&amp;amp;affiliation=All&amp;amp;program=126&amp;amp;term=All&amp;amp;citizenship=All&amp;amp;keyword=&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;june&quot;&gt;June&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure to accept your offer before the deadline, which is typically in June. Don’t slack off too much, as there are minimum grades you need to achieve to keep your offer and scholarships from being rescinded. If you didn’t get an offer to your desired program, you can email admissions to be considered for the waitlist; however, there are no guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;advice-from-recent-applicants&quot;&gt;Advice from Recent Applicants&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I interviewed several students who were recently admitted into Waterloo Engineering programs. My friend, Gary Zheng, wrote this entire section in the blog post. Big thank you to Gary for his efforts, and shoutouts to Agosh, Tanya, Paul, Mufeez, Kouthar, and Dymtro for sharing their insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-keep-your-aif-personal&quot;&gt;1. Keep your AIF personal.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably the most important piece of advice offered, iterated on by each student I’ve spoken to.
Do show that you have a vision—a dream—and how Waterloo can help you achieve it. Show your passion and commitment to this dream, and why you want it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do describe how your current skills and experiences apply to your program of choice.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t just praise Waterloo: talk about yourself. The AIF is a place for you to explain why you are a good fit for Waterloo, and why Waterloo is the university for you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t follow sample AIFs as it can lead to less authentic responses.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t write in essay structure (3-paragraph-hamburger).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t try to “fluff” your sentences with fancy words—write simple sentences from an interesting perspective. There is a character limit!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-start-your-application-early&quot;&gt;2. Start your application early.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t procrastinate! You probably have lots of other stuff to deal with: extracurriculars, homework, other university applications, or maybe even a job. But don’t leave your Waterloo application for the last moment!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting early gives you time to revise your AIF. No admissions officer wants to see a sloppy AIF. In terms of revision, it may help to read over your responses from the perspective of an admissions officer to guide your content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, submitting your AIF and video response early (before February) qualifies you for early admission. This can be very helpful as you essentially get considered twice, and your grade 11 marks may be better than your grade 12 marks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-extracurriculars&quot;&gt;3. Extracurriculars!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extracurriculars will be vital to your application, but don’t panic if you lack extraordinary things to write about. Plenty of students are admitted yearly without having listed many extracurriculars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Show you’re a well-rounded applicant by having extracurriculars unrelated to the program you applied to (in addition to related ones). But be wary if you do things just for the sake of the AIF, it might be hard for you to write passionately about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for younger students reading this post: start now. Contests are a great way to “pad” your application. Waterloo hosts a bunch of highschool-level contests yearly, for each grade (starting in grade 7). Performing poorly won’t hurt you, but doing well is a plus to your application, and you might even win a scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-make-use-of-resources-available-to-you&quot;&gt;4. Make use of resources available to you.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t be afraid to seek help when you have questions, or need help editing your AIF responses. There are numerous resources available to you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;School counselors (underrated, yet very helpful)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Professor Anderson’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://profbillanderson.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;William Bishop’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://theroadtoengineering.com/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Current Waterloo students and other applicants
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Friends, mutual friends, family friends&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Frosh groups on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/waterloo23/&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The UWaterloo &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/&quot;&gt;subreddit&lt;/a&gt; has an admissions megathread every year&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, research the programs you are applying to. This can help with your AIF content. For example, you could talk about Waterloo engineering’s cohort system, or the senior capstone project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-use-numbers&quot;&gt;5. Use numbers.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be beneficial to support your achievements with numbers, and provide sufficient context so the evaluator can understand the significance. For example, rather than saying “I created the X application,” you could say, “I created the X application, which has over 5000 weekly active users.” Or, instead of “I scored well on the 2018 Y competition,” say “I scored 98/100 on the 2018 Y competition, ranking top 25 in Ontario.” Use the “Extra Info” section on the AIF to brag about your achievements, no need to be humble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very importantly, &lt;strong&gt;do not lie&lt;/strong&gt;. There are horror stories of students having their offers rescinded, or being kicked out later, due to having been caught lying on their AIF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;6-try-to-relax-during-the-video-interview&quot;&gt;6. Try to relax during the video interview.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it’s easy to say “just relax,” but this is really important. Avoid re-stating the same thing over and over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One suggestion was to practice with friend and peers. You can also have a friend sit across from you when you are recording, so it feels like you’re talking to them rather than the camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;7-stop-worrying-about-other-applicants&quot;&gt;7. Stop worrying about other applicants.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t worry about what marks or extracurriculars other applicants have—it doesn’t impact &lt;strong&gt;your&lt;/strong&gt; application. Focus all of your energy on being the best person that you can be.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Lessons Learned from Powerlifting</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000///lessons-learned-from-powerlifting"/>
   <updated>2018-05-17T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/lessons-learned-from-powerlifting</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been lifting for 1.5 years now, and it’s become one of the best investments in my life. In this blog post, I’ll share the 9 most important lessons that I learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/gymcover.png&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I previously wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;/my-gym-transformation&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about my gym journey. What I’ve come to realize was that my biggest transformation wasn’t physical, but rather mental.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-mental-confidence&quot;&gt;1. Mental confidence.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I don’t believe I can lift a weight, then I probably can’t lift it. Before I attempt my heavy lifts, I always try to visualize myself doing the set and replaying that picture in my head. I’ve been able to transfer this skill into many other aspects of my life, where I try to mentally visualize success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first started lifting, I had a bunch of thoughts in my head that might sound familiar to all gym goers. &lt;em&gt;“I don’t know how to lift. I’m scared. I’m so weak. People are going to judge me.”&lt;/em&gt; Now that I’ve conquered this fear with lifting, I’ve become less scared to try new things. For example, I’ve always been terrified of dancing, but last week I tried salsa dancing for the first time. I didn’t care what people thought about me and I had a great time at the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/17ceu6/what_makes_squats_so_great/c84ag4n/&quot;&gt;my favourite quote&lt;/a&gt; about lifting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That weight when squatting isn’t pressure. It’s adversity. Remember that feeling. Hold it, picture it, grasp it, bottle it. That fear is you pushing yourself way you of your comfort zone. You’ll get that same fear doing anything worth doing. Anything that’s intimidating and challenging. When you squat you are transcending your adversity and fears. The weight is all of your doubts and fear manifested into a barbell and some weights. When you squat, you’re praying. For the strength and willpower the transcend your limits, for the ability to rise and get back up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-think-long-term&quot;&gt;2. Think long-term.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I squatted for the first time, I was whobbly with the 45lb bar. Now, I can squat 315lbs for 5 reps. During this journey, there were times where I was lifting with my &lt;em&gt;ego&lt;/em&gt;, and tried to go for unnecessary short-term personal records. This sometimes resulted in stalling, or even injuries. With an injury, your one month of good progress might suddenly become two months backwards in progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I still do celebrate small short-term victories every now and then, it’s the long-term mentality that I value the most. Assuming a steady and injury-free progress, I’ll be a heck lot stronger in a year from now than I am today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-time-management&quot;&gt;3. Time management.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spend about 10 hours a week lifting and commuting to and from the gym. Although it’s a large time investment, I’ve actually gained more productive time by being better at managing my time. I usually go to the gym in the mornings, so this forces me to sleep early and wake up early. During busy weeks, I make sure I focus on getting my work done, so I never have to skip a gym day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-progress-is-non-linear&quot;&gt;4. Progress is non-linear.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my first few months, I experienced the phenomenon called ‘beginner gains’, where I went up 5 lbs on my lifts every workout. Gaining strength is a lot harder to come by now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of my physical appearance, it changed quite a bit month-over-month in the first 9 months. After that phase, monthly changes were less noticeable. For anyone that wants to get started with lifting, the good news is that you can achieve a great physical transformation in under a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over a 10-20 year scale, I believe strength progress should be logarithmic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/logscale.png&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-train-smart-not-hard&quot;&gt;5. Train smart, not hard.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strength progress is not directly proportional to the amount of effort you spend training. You should come prepared with a plan that includes progressive overloading, and sick to the plan. Don’t be that person who goes to the gym, does random lifts, and makes no progress over months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also learned that more days of training doesn’t necessarily result in better progress than less days of training, i.e. 6 days vs 4 days. It’s possible to overtrain, which negatively affects your progress by not getting enough rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-focus-on-one-thing&quot;&gt;6. Focus on one thing.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I want to gain strength, be lean, and build muscle.”&lt;/em&gt; While it’s not impossible to achieve that statement, it’s definitely very difficult to achieve naturally. Instead of trying to achieve everything, I would recommend to just stick with one thing. For months, I was running a program that promoted both powerlifting and bodybuilding. Though I did get a bit of strength, and some size, I felt like it wasn’t ideal for progress overall. After I switched to a program that focused exclusively on strength, I increased my squat by 45lbs in 10 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/gymsquat.png&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;7-lifting-is-only-20-of-the-work&quot;&gt;7. Lifting is only 20% of the work.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remaining 80% comes from proper dieting, staying consistent, getting enough rest, and training smart. If you lift and don’t eat well, you won’t get great progress. If you’re trying to lose weight and don’t change your eating habits, you won’t get far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Abs are made in the kitchen, not the gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;8-social-environment&quot;&gt;8. Social environment.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By design, the gym is a community of people that share similar interests. It’s a great way to make friends. If you’re ever looking to make new friends or bond with existing friends, the gym is an awesome place to go to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/gymbuddies.png&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;9-be-obsessed&quot;&gt;9. Be obsessed.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lesson doesn’t apply to everyone. Since discovering powerlifting, I’ve become obsessed with it. I want to constantly improve myself in all aspects. I record my workout videos, and watch them to see where I can improve my form. I preach lifting to my friends and co-workers. I’ve written two blog posts about lifting. You get the point. Whether this obsession is positive or negative, I’m genuinely happy to have discovered something that makes me so passionate. 😄&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Cali or Bust Conundrum</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000///cali-or-bust"/>
   <updated>2018-05-15T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/the-cali-or-bust-conundrum</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A recent study highlighted the brain drain problem for tech talent in Canada. In this post, I will explain the ‘Cali or bust’ movement and describe its effect on the tech brain drain. In addition, I will provide 8 recommendations to retain and attract top Canadian tech talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/goldengatebridge.png&quot; alt=&quot;Golden Gate Bridge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, California (PC: Paul Bardea)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;brain-drain-report&quot;&gt;Brain Drain Report&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://brocku.ca/social-sciences/political-science/wp-content/uploads/sites/153/Reversing-the-Brain-Drain.pdf&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; led by Zachary Spicer, found that 25% of recent tech grads from Canada were working in the US. To summarize the study, the team collected data from 3,162 LinkedIn profiles of graduates from University of British Columbia (UBC), University of Waterloo (UW), and University of Toronto (U of T).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that 52% of this sample size were UW graduates in Software Engineering (SE), Electrical &amp;amp; Computer Engineering (ECE), Systems Design Engineering (SYDE), Computer Science (CS), and Mathematics. These programs are all highly competitive and generally require students to complete 5 or 6 co-op terms. Engineering Science, ECE, and CS graduates from U of T and UBC make up most of the remaining data points. These programs are also highly competitive and offer co-op or PEY opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these facts, it would be far from the truth to extrapolate the report results to Canada as a whole. The University of Waterloo is the #1 feeder school to Silicon Valley and large US tech companies. Given that UW grads represents the majority of the sample, it would be extremely unfair to make any conclusions about Canada STEM students in general. A more accurate phrasing would be “25% of recent SE/CS/ECE graduates from Canada’s top undergrad programs such as UW are working in the US”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally think that the Canadian tech brain drain problem is being overblown, as these results do not represent Canada collectively. However, I do believe that at UW specifically, brain drain is a major problem. For the remainder of this post, I will be focusing solely on analyzing brain drain at UW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-cali-or-bust&quot;&gt;What is ‘Cali or bust’?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Cali or bust’ is a catch phrase and meme that was popularized on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/&quot;&gt;/r/uwaterloo&lt;/a&gt; in mid-2016. There is a general misconception that this maxim means “I must only consider and get an internship offer in California or else I have failed”. For most students, a more accurate interpretation is “I will try my best to get an internship in the US or at a well-known US tech company. I will use more than half of my co-op applications for these competitive roles in the main round. If I ‘bust’ in the main round, I will open up my options for the continuous round.” Despite not being located California, Google Waterloo, Bloomberg NYC, and Amazon Toronto are all considered ‘Cali’ in the mentioned maxim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cali or bust&lt;/em&gt;: When you use most of your co-op applications for competitive US companies. ‘Cali’ = receiving an internship offer for a competitive US company. ‘Bust’ = failing to get ‘Cali’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reasons for why a student would ‘Cali or bust’ are: higher internship pay in the US, experience new locations &amp;amp; cultures, work at reputable companies, and the fact that the many of their classmates are also heading to the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;consequences-of-cali-or-bust&quot;&gt;Consequences of ‘Cali or bust’&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The winners of the ‘Cali or bust’ movement are UW students, US tech companies, and UW. The losers are: UW students, Canadian tech companies, the Canadian tech industry, and the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For students, ‘Cali or bust’ isn’t regarded as a negative mindset to have. UW students should be able to pursue whatever opportunities maximize their potential. It just happens that the majority of these opportunities are located in the US. As mentioned before, there are countless reasons why a UW student would consider ‘Cali or bust’. There is little to none real incentive for a UW student to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; ‘Cali or bust’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tech industry in Silicon Valley is the equivalent of the film industry in Hollywood. It’s regarded as &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; place where shit gets done. Silicon Valley and Hollywood are the world’s largest supercluster of opportunities for their respective industries. Opportunities in the US vs. Canada is like comparing the NFL to the CFL. The former is far more reputable and prestigious than the latter; the difference in salaries is also quite significant. Of course, in both examples, it’s important to note that there are still excellent opportunities outside of the industry leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, UW’s co-op program provides a perfect gateway for students to ‘Cali or bust’. It’s very common for CEOs and engineering leaders of US companies to fly into Waterloo to recruit students. For reference, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ceca.uwaterloo.ca/students/sessions.php&quot;&gt;here’s&lt;/a&gt; the employer info session calendar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, at the same time, UW students can also be losers. ‘Cali or bust’ also promotes a toxic competitive environment amongst students, where co-op jobs that are not ‘Cali’ may be considered inferior. This creates a detrimental effect to many students’ self worth when they ‘bust’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, the only clear, real winners of ‘Cali or bust’ are the US tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-uw-students-work-in-the-us-after-graduation&quot;&gt;Why UW students work in the US after graduation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was an SE student, over 60% of my class worked in the US for their 5th co-op term. For new grad roles, this number will be in a similar ballpark. Amongst the CS/SE/ECE/SYDE programs at UW, over 30% of new grads will work in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The #1 reason why UW students move to the US is the massive difference in total compensation, which I previously wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/canada-new-grad-offers-2017-2018-bo-peng/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. After considering taxes and cost of living, your take-home income can be 50 to 100% higher in the US compared to Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other reasons include: company reputation, scope of work, professional development, peers, location preferences, and personal factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ‘Cali or bust’ movement for getting the best internships directly affects the UW brain drain problem. For full-time opportunities, students are likely to return to an employer from their final 3 co-op terms. For example, Facebook is known to offer a 75K USD signing bonus for returning interns, which is higher than many Canadian companies’ salaries. When an exceptional full-time offer is thrown at you, and combined with an expiring deadline, it’s extremely hard to even consider opportunities in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, the ‘Cali or bust’ movement is the primary driver of migration. If a student has interned in the US, they’re much more likely to return to the US. If a student has only interned in Canada, then they’re more likely to remain in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As more and more students successfully achieve ‘Cali or bust’, the movement compounds into increasing brain drain for UW graduates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reduce UW’s brain drain, the onus is on Canadian tech companies and the university. I have come up with the following recommendations to address the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;co-op-jobs&quot;&gt;Co-op jobs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, Canadian tech companies must significantly improve their internship programs. By retaining students in Canada for their final internships, they are more likely to remain after graduation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1: Increase the salary of senior co-op jobs to at least CAD $40 per hour.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For students, a short term goal is to pay for next term’s tuition and reduce student loan. Co-op jobs in Canada currently pay on average CAD &lt;a href=&quot;https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/why-co-op/co-op-earnings/hourly-earnings-information-january-december-2017&quot;&gt;$26 per hour&lt;/a&gt;, whereas US employers pay students USD $40 per hour, and also offer generous housing stipends. A US co-op job is even more competitive when you consider the USD to CAD exchange rate. To satisfy a student’s short term financial goals, it’s critical to increase the salary of top Canadian co-op jobs. For Canadian tech companies, increasing co-op salaries can lead to increases in the quantity and quality of talent, as well as intern to full-time conversions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2: Incentivize former interns to return for another internship in their final terms.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One excellent tactic I’ve learned about is PagerDuty’s return intern offer. Former interns who return to PagerDuty for their last co-op term receive a $10,000 one-time bonus. This seems to work well for them, as many new full-time engineers are direct intern conversions. Microsoft also does a similar tactic by offering returning interns a $5,000 one-time bonus. Incentives can also be responsibility based. For example, Canadian tech companies can offer interns to work on more senior technical projects and provide invaluable learning opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3: Get engineering directors to sell an intern on returning for full-time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an intern, I would appreciate having an engineering director sell me on returning full-time over a recruiter. Most Canadian companies cannot offer a compensation package that is competitive to US companies. This means that it’s crucial for a director to sell the intern on the impact and professional development they will experience. The time commitment could be as little as a 30 minute 1 on 1 with the intern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;full-time-compensation&quot;&gt;Full-time compensation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4: Increase total compensation by offering stocks/equity/options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If increasing salary is not possible, then Canadian tech companies should be prepared to offer long-term compensation bonuses to be competitive with US companies. Stocks/equity/options also help the employee feel more personally invested into the company. Perhaps, the government can consider investing into a one-time grant for companies to provide a signing bonus for co-op students beginning their first full-time job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;international-students&quot;&gt;International students&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a &lt;a href=&quot;https://uwaterloo.ca/institutional-analysis-planning/university-data-and-statistics/student-data/student-headcounts&quot;&gt;quarter&lt;/a&gt; of CS/SE students at UW are international students. UW graduates who are Canadian citizens currently have the privilege of working in the US easily via the TN visa. However, for international students, acquiring an H1B visa to work in the US is very difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5: Target international students and retain them in Canada for full-time opportunities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canadian tech companies can take advantage of international students’ visa situation by investing into recruiting them. From the discussions I’ve had with my friends who are international students, they all seemed very impressed with Canada as a country. Tech companies can sell international students on the roadmap to getting a Canadian permanent residence. Similarly, from orientation week to the graduation ceremony, UW should be proactively convincing and supporting international students to remain in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;us-satellite-offices&quot;&gt;US satellite offices&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;6: Welcome more US satellite offices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some great examples are Google Waterloo, Amazon Vancouver, and Facebook Montreal. Although US companies will steal potential tech talent from nearby small and mid-sized companies, it does provide lucrative opportunities for UW graduates to pursue. The government should be proactive in welcoming new US satellite offices due to the well-paying jobs created, and the net increase in tech talent retained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;re-acquiring-canadian-tech-talent-from-the-us&quot;&gt;Re-acquiring Canadian tech talent from the US&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to retaining graduates, another important goal is to re-acquire Canadian tech talent that migrated to the US. A common theme in my conversations with UW graduates and friends is that they expressed strong interest in wanting to return to Canada in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;7: UW should proactively sell alumni into returning to Canada.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UW communications team should be communicating the state of Canadian tech to alumni on an annual basis. For alumni who have spent years in the US, they are likely to be out of touch with what’s happening in the world of Canadian tech. For in-person events such as the 5 and 10 year alumni reunion, UW needs to send a strong message to welcome alumni back home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;8: Tech companies should target senior engineers and leaders in the US, and sell them on “coming home” and taking on additional responsibility.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@fungmoney/how-we-landed-one-of-canadas-most-sought-after-engineering-leaders-1f7be6cdd4ef&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent example of a Canadian startup convincing an engineering leader from the US to join them. Although Canadian tech companies won’t be able to match the candidate’s previous compensation, what they can do is selling them on the company’s vision and values. They can also sell the candidate on ‘levelling up professionally, i.e. taking on additional technical or management responsibility. Recruiters and engineering leaders at Canadian tech companies should proactively target UW alumni who have gathered 5-10 years of experience in the US and sell them into “coming home”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Best day ever.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-get-tickets&quot;&gt;How to get tickets&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a Broadway fan can become a fairly expensive hobby, as tickets are usually $150-200+. The good news is that there are many ways to get affordably priced tickets. With the exception of Hamilton, I paid between $30 to $42 for my Broadway tickets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-purchase-directly-from-the-box-office&quot;&gt;1. Purchase directly from the box office&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can accomplish this by going to the show’s website or visiting the box office in person. As mentioned before, you should expect to pay $150+ per ticket. Popular shows are usually completely sold out, so this method may not always be available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-purchase-from-a-reseller&quot;&gt;2. Purchase from a reseller&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes sites such as Stubhub, Ticketmaster, Craiglist, etc. The tickets are often significantly marked up on the face value, so this can end up becoming the most expensive method. In addition, there is always a risk of fraudulent tickets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-rush-tickets&quot;&gt;3. Rush tickets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rush tickets originated from the iconic musical, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.playbill.com/article/from-sleeping-on-the-streets-to-swiping-on-a-screen-the-evolution-of-rush-tickets-from-rent-to-digital-lotteries-com-361078&quot;&gt;Rent&lt;/a&gt;, where tickets for the first two rows were sold for $20 each first come first serve. Some shows offer ‘rush’ tickets, where you can purchase same day tickets for $30-40 when the box office opens. The twist is that it’s first come first serve, so you’ll have to line up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-in-person-lottery&quot;&gt;4. In person lottery&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most popular shows, you can imagine people arriving several hours before the box office opens to purchase rush tickets. The theaters discourage people &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.playbill.com/article/rent-changing-rush-ticket-policy-com-70938&quot;&gt;camping out&lt;/a&gt;, so an in person lottery was introduced. For some shows, 2.5 hours before the start time, you can submit a lottery entry in person. The theatre will announce the results 30 minutes later. These tickets are similarly priced to rush tickets. I would encourage attending at least one in person lottery, as it’s a very fun experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/bookofmormon.png&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Book of Mormon in person lottery&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-digital-lottery&quot;&gt;5. Digital lottery&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To save a trip to the in person lottery, daily digital lotteries were introduced, so you can submit an entry online. Your chances of winning the digital lottery are directly proportional to the number of people entering. For a popular show like Hamilton, your odds are not great. Trust me, I’ve entered everyday for 2 years. However, for a show like Spongebob, many of my friends have won the lottery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;6-standing-room-only-tickets&quot;&gt;6. Standing-room only tickets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standing-room tickets are the cheapest options. They’re usually only available for sale when all of the seats are occupied. You can purchase them by going to the box office in person when it opens. This is how I got to watch Dear Evan Hansen for only $42.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/dearevanhansen.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Great views from standing-room only tickets&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;7-tkts&quot;&gt;7. TKTS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Theatre Development Fund operates three TKTS discount booths, where you can purchase same day Broadway tickets at a discount. They won’t be as cheap as rush or lottery tickets, but they are cheaper than the box office. For the most popular shows, the discount booths will not carry those tickets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;8-todaytix&quot;&gt;8. TodayTix&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an online website that sells discounted last-minute tickets. Tickets are more affordable than purchasing directly from the box office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;9-cancellation-line&quot;&gt;9. Cancellation line&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For any given performance, there are almost always cancellation tickets available at the box office before a performance begins. These tickets are sold at face value, and usually are great seats. I waited in the cancellation line for Hamilton on a Tuesday morning, and managed to grab two tickets for $229 each. It might sound pricey, but it was by far cheaper than the resellers’ price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/hamiltonseats.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hamilton 6th row Orchestra cancellation tickets&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;theatre-seating&quot;&gt;Theatre seating&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Broadway theatre is typically arranged into 6 sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Centre Orchestra&lt;/em&gt;: Ground level, and center relative to the stage. The best seats in the house. The first two rows might be a bit too close to comfort, so they’re usually offered in the lottery/rush tickets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Side Orchestra&lt;/em&gt;: Ground level, and left/right relative to the stage, respectively. If you’re too far left or too far right, the seat might be labelled partial view, so you’ll miss parts of the show.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Front Mezzanine&lt;/em&gt;: The lowest balcony of the theatre. Seat in the center front mezzanine are desired.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rear Mezzanine&lt;/em&gt;: A higher balcony than the front mezzanine. Usually the cheapest tickets in the theatre.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Box seats&lt;/em&gt;: Small separated seating area that floats on each side of the stage. Usually partial view.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Standing-room only&lt;/em&gt;: Spaces where you can stand. They’re located behind the furthest Orchestra seats. Views might be good sometimes!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rush and lottery tickets are usually the less desirable seats such as partial view, rear mezzanine, or standing-room only. However, it really depends on the theatre, as I’ve gotten rush tickets that were in the side orchestra and had a full view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-tips&quot;&gt;My tips&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all 14 shows I’ve watched so far, I purchased the tickets at a substantial discount relative to their actual price. Here’s a list of tips I have for you to get cheap tickets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Submit the digital lottery for every show, every day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find a Broadway buddy to double your chances because rush and lottery tickets can be purchased in pairs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to in person lotteries on a weeknight rather than the weekend.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tuesday mornings are great for rush and cancellation tickets.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Monitor the price of tickets on reseller website. There is a possibility the price drastically drops right before the show starts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read about the cancellation/rush/standing-room only thread on Broadway World. For example, this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.broadwayworld.com/board/readmessage.php?thread=1081132&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; was super useful information when I tried to get Hamilton cancellation tickets. Or this thread for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.broadwayworld.com/board/readmessage.php?thread=1100089&quot;&gt;Dear Evan Hansen&lt;/a&gt; standing-room only tickets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;resources&quot;&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.broadwayforbrokepeople.com/&quot;&gt;BroadwayForBrokePeople.com&lt;/a&gt;: useful information for all cheap tickets&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytix.com/Links/Broadway/lotteryschedule.html&quot;&gt;NY Tix Schedule&lt;/a&gt;: displays the schedule for lottery and rush tickets&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.broadwayworld.com/&quot;&gt;Broadway World&lt;/a&gt;: contains show reviews and a discussion board&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aviewfrommyseat.com/&quot;&gt;A View From My Seat&lt;/a&gt;: displays pictures of how the view from a seat looks like&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Canada New Grad Offers 2017-2018</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000///canada-new-grad-offers"/>
   <updated>2018-01-05T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/Canada-new-grad-offers</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was recently motivated to kick off an initiative to collect new grad offer data for roles based in Canada. I posted this &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd9C3tB1ybxh5ZxsLbf_Z11t9dMwTn02Jbu8wvNbixCH4DjSw/viewform?usp=sf_link&quot;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; on Hackathon Hackers, Facebook groups, Reddit, LinkedIn, and other sources. To my delight, the survey received over 200 crowdsourced responses (60% which were software development roles). I went through all responses, carefully inspected the data, and then cleaned the data to provide a better reading and analysis experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pt-itiRQc_bcMxbddYP0Kv_X81bQDUoW2dUfYQRVg4E/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;2017-2018 Canada New Grad offer survey responses and analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: For this survey, the emphasis was on the tech industry. The numbers analyzed below are based only on software development related roles, and are represented in CAD currency.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;survey-goals&quot;&gt;Survey Goals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To promote transparency of new grad compensation packages in Canada&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To provide individualized offer packages of top tech companies in Canada&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To analyze trends and provide suggestions in optimizing new grad offers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To compare Canada new grad offers vs. US new grad offers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-does-a-new-grad-offer-package-consist-of&quot;&gt;What does a new grad offer package consist of?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An offer package consists of five major components: base salary, one time signing bonus, annually recurring stocks/bonus, paid vacation days, and other benefits (i.e. health, gym, wellness allowance). To view specific details of a company, please refer to the ‘Raw Data’ section in the survey spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The median and mean base salary were respectively $74,000 and $76,000. This is line with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.glassdoor.ca/Salaries/canada-software-engineer-salary-SRCH_IL.0,6_IN3_KO7,24.htm&quot;&gt;Glassdoor’s reported average&lt;/a&gt; for software developers/engineers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-much-are-new-grads-making-at-tech-companies-in-canada&quot;&gt;How much are new grads making at tech companies in Canada?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/salarygraphic.png&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The graphic above is composed of new grad offers from selected tech companies in Canada. It’s apparent that large American tech companies (Google, Amazon, Microsoft) with Canadian offices pay the most to new grads. Some Canada headquartered companies like Shopify and Wealthsimple also pay quite well, with a total compensation package of over $100K. Given that the average base salary is around ~$75K, companies like IBM, AMD, Cisco all fall around that range. While these big name companies hire many new grads, it is not representative of what an average new grad should expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, if money is a major factor for you in Canada, aim for a Big N American tech company with offices in Canada, or a top Canadian startup/company like Wealthsimple or Shopify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Of course, there’s much more to life and decision making than just money!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gender&quot;&gt;Gender&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/gendersalary.png&quot; alt=&quot;Gender graphic&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the 106 responses, females represented 16% of the responses. Their median and average base salary were lower than their male counterparts by about 5~10%. In this particular survey, this may not be statistically significant due to the small sample size. Unfortunately, in the general tech industry, there is no doubt that the gender pay gap is a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;location&quot;&gt;Location&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/locationsalary.png&quot; alt=&quot;Location graphic&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Areas like Toronto and Vancouver yielded higher base salaries than other parts in Canada. This can be attributed to the higher costs of living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;school&quot;&gt;School&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/schoolsalary.png&quot; alt=&quot;School graphic&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of the survey responses were from University of Waterloo and University of Toronto students. Waterloo students may have a higher starting base salary because they have 2 years of co-op work experience prior to graduation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;previously-interned-at-company&quot;&gt;Previously interned at company&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/internsalary.png&quot; alt=&quot;Intern graphic&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the 112 responses, 46 new grad offers were from people who previously interned at the same company. The base salary was significantly higher than the other groupings. One potential explanation is well-paying tech companies (i.e. Amazon, Google, Shopify) attract many interns, and then convert them to full time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s evident that investing in a great internship program builds a great funnel for full time employees. &lt;strong&gt;I believe this is the key in retaining young Canadian tech talent in Canada.&lt;/strong&gt; If an intern has a great experience at a Canadian tech company, they are more likely to sacrifice the additional compensation in US to remain in Canada. Sell them on the &lt;em&gt;culture&lt;/em&gt;, not the money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To university students: finding your third year internship might be one of the most impactful processes in university.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;negotiation&quot;&gt;Negotiation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/negotiationsalary.png&quot; alt=&quot;Negotiation graphic&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 50% of students don’t try negotiating at all. Negotiating is one of the most important skills in life, but it’s not something that’s taught in school. The students who were successful in negotiations had a higher salary than those who didn’t try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amongst the 77 males that responded, 21% were successful in negotiating, and 26% attempted negotiating but were unsuccessful. 53% did not attempt negotiating at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amongst the 17 females that responded, 18% were successful in negotiating, and 18% attempted negotiating but were unsuccessful. 64% did not attempt negotiating at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This suggests that females are less likely to negotiate their new grad offers than their male counterparts. This is a potential reason why females are paid less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the grouping that were successful in negotiations, a $5K increase in base salary was the most frequent response. To new grads: why wouldn’t you spend 30 minutes negotiating for a chance to get paid $5K more?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 5 internship offers that I’ve accepted, I’ve attempted negotiating every single time. I was successful 3 times, and on average increased my annualized salary by $6 to 10K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you read through the ‘Negotiation’ and ‘Negotiation effects’ columns in the ‘Raw Data’ tab, you can find interesting perspectives on students’ negotiation experiences. One example is the Amazon new grad offer. One student commented “Amazon doesn’t negotiate new grad offers.” Another student commented “increased Amazon base salary by $5,000”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second example is IBM Canada’s $3,000 signing bonus. If you don’t ask for it, you probably won’t get it. However, if you do try to negotiate and ask for it, there’s a solid chance they’ll offer the $3K to you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;canada-vs-usa&quot;&gt;Canada vs. USA&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if we compare Canadian tech offers to US tech offers, we find a world of difference. Credit: Jesse Collins for compiling this &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@jtc/fall-2015-intern-new-grad-offers-472952ffb553&quot;&gt;data set and analysis&lt;/a&gt;. The numbers are in USD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/ussalary.png&quot; alt=&quot;US graphic&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Jesse’s crowdsourced initiative with over 300 full time US new grad offers, the average new grad offer was $97,356 in salary, $16,493 in stock per year, and $27,886 in signing bonus. This yields a total compensation of $141,000 USD. This survey was completed in 2015, so it is likely the total compensation has increased for 2018 new grad offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average Canadian new grad offer was ~$75,000 in base salary and approximately ~$7,000 in combined signing and recurring bonuses. It’s important to note that the majority of Canadian new grad tech offers does not include a signing bonus or stock bonus. Students working at the highest paying tech companies should expect a number that far exceeds $7,000. Most students should expect a bonus that’s less than $7,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From an absolute numbers perspective, it’s evident that Canadian new grad offers are significantly lower than US new grad offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further support this claim, the Software Engineering department at the University of Waterloo has generously shared the 2017 exit survey results with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/sesalary.png&quot; alt=&quot;SE graphic&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, we find that that the average Canada new grad total compensation was $107,000 for SE 2017 students. The average US new grad total compensation was $196,000 (~$151K USD). The Seattle total compensation is $215,500, which yields even more money because there is no state income tax in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we compare US base salaries to Canadian base salaries, the playing field is relatively close. &lt;strong&gt;However, once we include the total compensation, the US new grad offer blows the Canada new grad offer out of the water.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average new grad offer for SE 2017 students are not representative of what a new grad should expect. SE students complete six 4 month internships prior to graduation, and this particular survey consisted only of 17 Canadian data points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;real-earnings&quot;&gt;Real earnings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the section above, the US offers are significantly better than the Canadian offers. Now, if we consider cost of living, how much money do people actually take home?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some may claim that the cost of living in New York, Silicon Valley, and Seattle are very high, and that a one bedroom place can cost $3,000~$3,500 a month. A one bedroom place may indeed cost that much; however, a reasonable new grad will not spend that much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amongst the 50+ Waterloo alumni working in the US that I’ve spoken to, the majority of them only spend $1,200~$1,800 per month on rent. They get their own bedroom, but have to share a house/apartment with a few others. In cities like Toronto and Vancouver, the cost of living is increasing and is becoming comparable to the major US tech cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the figure below, I present a simple calculation of take home income after deducting tax, rent, food, and miscellaneous expenses. I used these two sites for income tax calculators: &lt;a href=&quot;https://smartasset.com/taxes/income-taxes#99Z6UkUUs3&quot;&gt;US tax&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://simpletax.ca/calculator&quot;&gt;Canada tax&lt;/a&gt;. For rent, I assume you get your own bedroom and share a place with 2-3 others. For food, I assumed a constant value of $600. This figure highly varies based on the individual. Many tech companies in the US also provide 2-3 meals per day. I assumed a conservatively high value of $500 per month for the ‘other’ section, which includes entertainment and other miscellaneous expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/citiessalary.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cities graphic&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering just the base salary, the take home income in US offers yield ~40% more than Canadian offers. Now, if we consider the total compensation package, which is about $141,000 USD for US offers, and $82,000 for Canada offers, then the gap widens to 80% more. In the chart below, I simplified the calculations by adding the signing bonus and recurring bonuses directly to the base salary. I am not a tax expert, and there may be minor implications caused by this simplification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/citiessalary2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cities graphic&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The calculations do not consider deductions, RRSP matching, TFSA, compound interest, and the current bullish market. These considerations would increase the actual value of an individual’s financial portfolio, and further widen the gap between US and Canada. Furthermore, these calculations assume the perspective of a new grad who is willing to share a unit with 2-3 others. If I had assumed an individual pays $3,500 a month for a 1BR apartment in SF/NYC, then the gap would be narrower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applying the same expenses calculation above, the take home income for Shopify ($115K total compensation) yields $58K CAD. If we cared only about the local currency, then this is comparable to a US company in the US which has a total compensation of $141K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, most Canadian new grad offers are not comparable to the US opportunities. This is the major reason why so many of my peers and Waterloo friends will move to the US after graduation. If we look beyond new grad offers, the pay difference between US and Canada tech compensation grows even larger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we want to retain Canada’s tech talent, Canadian tech companies must:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Provide stronger compensation packages (&amp;gt;90K total compensation in CAD)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build strong internship programs that sell an intern on the company’s culture and convert them to full time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion--personal-reflection&quot;&gt;Conclusion &amp;amp; Personal Reflection&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kicked off this initiative because I wanted to promote transparency of new grad offers in Canada. I also previously led an initiative to collect internship reviews and salaries: &lt;a href=&quot;https://interncompass.io/&quot;&gt;InternCompass.io&lt;/a&gt;. I’m graduating in August 2018, and I have to make one of the biggest decisions of my life: where do I begin my career? This question inspired me to work on this initiative. I hope that this article will help many new grads with their decisions and process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve had an opportunity to live and work in the major tech hubs of USA: Silicon Valley, New York, and Seattle. I grew up in Toronto, and genuinely think it’s one of the best places in the world. Compensation is just one of many factors; however, when there is such a significant pay difference, it’s hard to overlook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find it quite unfortunate that there exists a huge brain drain problem in Canadian tech. The government grows strong talent for 22 years, nurtures them with excellent healthcare and subsidized education programs, only to lose them to large US tech corporations. Tech CEOs in Canada often complain about the brain drain issue, but only a few companies like Shopify and Wealthsimple are actually putting money where their mouth is. This post serves both as an avenue to promote transparency for students, as well as an open letter to Canadian tech CEOs to take action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bias-and-disclaimers&quot;&gt;Bias and disclaimers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This survey was shared in Facebook groups, Reddit, and LinkedIn. Be aware that there is a selection bias in who responds to the survey.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This survey received 200 responses, and only 60% of responses (software developer roles) were used in analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This data set is not big enough to draw broad conclusions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I personally chose the 13 companies to feature in the graphic. They are not representative of the average new grad offer in Canada.&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>2017 Year in Review</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000///2017-year-in-review"/>
   <updated>2017-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/2017-year-in-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;2017 was an incredible year for me. In this blog post, I will provide a recap of my 2017 year, and set new goals for 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/newyearsameme.png&quot; alt=&quot;Class picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;2017: New year, &lt;s&gt;new&lt;/s&gt; same me. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2017-recap&quot;&gt;2017 Recap&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I was on 21 one-way flights, equivalent to my previous lifetime total.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;why-I-transfered-from-SE-to-CS&quot;&gt;transferred from SE to CS&lt;/a&gt;. I will now graduate in August 2018, so I will begin job hunting in January or February. (Hello full-time friends who can help me out! 😄)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Made significant &lt;a href=&quot;my-gym-transformation&quot;&gt;strength and aesthetics progress&lt;/a&gt;, including a 405lb deadlift PR!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Secured a &lt;a href=&quot;how-I-got-a-job-at-linkedin-by-using-linkedin&quot;&gt;co-op offer at LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, and the opportunity to return to my favourite place in the world: New York City. 🗽&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Had a great time at &lt;a href=&quot;http://2017.cusec.net/&quot;&gt;CUSEC 2017&lt;/a&gt; in Montreal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An awesome &lt;a href=&quot;unforgettable-summer-internship-at-axon&quot;&gt;internship at Axon&lt;/a&gt;. The summer weather in Seattle is spectacular.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6339532432571797504&quot;&gt;Rode along with police officers&lt;/a&gt; across the US and watched them use lackluster software solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Flew to Hollywood and learned about how the industry works there.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Went on the &lt;a href=&quot;axon-grand-canyon-trip-2017&quot;&gt;best trip of my life&lt;/a&gt; to date. Spent a week rafting and camping along the Colorado River, and then hiked out of the Grand Canyon.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Discovered how amazing the Bose QC 35 Wireless Headphones were – they literally changed my life.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finally stopped procrastinating and kicked off the &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/forms/EtBFEGbNlrdcyqzx2&quot;&gt;Canada new grad offer survey&lt;/a&gt;. I will publish a blog post describing the results on January 5th.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turned 21 a few weeks ago, finally legal in America!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh man, what an incredible year it’s been. These were just a few of many memories that I loved about 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in February, I wrote a blog post about the &lt;a href=&quot;below-the-iceberg-surface&quot;&gt;iceberg illusion&lt;/a&gt;. I was very proud of writing that post because it was the first time I openly discussed struggles that I was facing. In 2018, I wish to write more about challenging moments, so that my blog can be more relatable and personal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2018-goals&quot;&gt;2018 Goals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year ago, I had set several &lt;a href=&quot;/farewell-2016-hello-2017&quot;&gt;goals&lt;/a&gt; for my 2017 year. Though I’m pleased that I achieved most of them, I also realized that some of these goals didn’t really matter that much to me. For example, one goal that I described was “&lt;em&gt;significantly reduce my use of plastic water bottles&lt;/em&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 2018, I’m setting goals that are much simpler and more meaningful to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be happy and healthy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be brave and vulnerable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maintain &amp;amp; develop great relationships.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Graduate.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get full-time job offer(s).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Join the 1000lb club for squat/bench/deadlift total.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m feeling quite bullish about 2018. I can’t wait for the new people and experiences 2018 will bring to my life!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why I transferred from SE to CS</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000///why-I-transfered-from-SE-to-CS"/>
   <updated>2017-12-24T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/why-i-transfered-from-se-to-cs</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, it brings me both joy and sadness to announce that I am transferring from SE to CS. In this blog post, I want to share my reasons for switching and some key lessons learned in the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/secover2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Class picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;SE 2019 class picture. (Winter 2015)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four years ago, I was a clueless 17 year old kid spamming refresh on Waterloo’s admission status page. If you checked my browsing history, you’d find &lt;a href=&quot;https://yconic.com/&quot;&gt;yconic.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/&quot;&gt;quest.uwaterloo.ca&lt;/a&gt; were my most frequently visited sites. I eagerly waited for an admission offer to Waterloo’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/programs/software-engineering&quot;&gt;Software Engineering program&lt;/a&gt;. As you may know, Waterloo SE is one of Canada’s most competitive undergrad programs to get into, alongside McMaster Health Sciences, UofT Engineering Science, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/blogs/insight/the-5-toughest-undergrad-programs-in-canada-to-get-210150421.html&quot;&gt;etc&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On February 20, 2014, I was admitted into SE. I felt amazing and immediately knew that Waterloo would be my home for the next &lt;em&gt;five&lt;/em&gt; years of my life. Although the offer deadline was in June, I literally accepted my offer the same night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/acceptedwaterloo.png&quot; alt=&quot;aif cover&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;You can tell I was pretty excited...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, I will present the perceived reasons of why I chose SE and compare them to what I actually experienced in SE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: these are my personal opinions – your mileage may vary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tl;dr:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Four years ago, I chose SE over CS. Looking back, it was the optimal decision.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The cohort and community that SE offered was the highlight of my undergrad.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Many courses were interesting, but I disliked the engineering requirement courses.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After 3B, I transferred to CS for the flexibility.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Summary: The SE cohort made the entire program worth it, as I’ve built so many great relationships. The engineering courses in SE were not worth it for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-i-chose-se&quot;&gt;Why I chose SE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-cohort&quot;&gt;1. Cohort.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All engineering programs at Waterloo are bunched into cohorts, so you share mostly the same schedule with your peers for 5 years. Cohort systems makes it very easy to make new friends, and develop a sense of community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-co-op&quot;&gt;2. Co-op.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the #1 reason why engineering, math, and CS students choose Waterloo. I’m sure you’ve heard stories about students getting amazing jobs at Google, Apple, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-prestige&quot;&gt;3. Prestige.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, SE is one of the most competitive programs in Canada. People naturally are attracted to this program, simply because it’s so hard to get into. As an individual raised in an Asian family, I’ve heard this same story way too many times: “My friend’s daughter/son is in X program, is doing very well, therefore you should also do X program.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or you might have also heard of this one as well: “OMG I have a 97% average, will I get into Waterloo SE?” To be totally honest with you, program prestige was one of the main reasons why I chose SE over other programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3b-influence-from-parents&quot;&gt;3b. Influence from parents.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents wanted the best for me, and they thought SE would be the best for my future. They were very well aware that SE is a prestigious program, and it would be amazing for their son to attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-the-tech-industry-presented-great-career-opportunities&quot;&gt;4. The tech industry presented great career opportunities.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tech sector provides great opportunities and I would be guaranteed a well-paying career after graduation. As a 17 year old kid, it’s hard to know what you want to do for the rest of your life. For some students, software development might actually be their dream career, and that’s awesome for them. However, for the rest of the student population, the actual story is more like “Yeah, I think I would be OK with doing software development. It might not be my primary interest, but I find it interesting and it pays well.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-i-was-good-in-math-physics-and-engineering-courses-in-high-school&quot;&gt;5. I was good in math, physics, and engineering courses in high school.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like all SE/CS applicants, we were all very high achieving in academics back in high school. I received high marks in courses like advanced functions, calculus, physics, and chemistry. These high school courses were all relatively easy, as a result, I thought I was interested in these subjects. I thought to myself, “Math, physics, and engineering were interesting in high school, so they should also be OK in university.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5b-you-can-become-an-accredited-professional-engineer-and-get-an-iron-ring&quot;&gt;5b. You can become an accredited professional engineer and get an iron ring.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back then, I was thinking “Woah, that’s cool. I can become a professional engineer as well, that’s like a two-in-one.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These 5 reasons were what attracted me to SE, with strong emphasis on the first three points. I’d be willing to bet that at least 90% of SE students share most of these sentiments. One point that I didn’t mention was that SE students can easily transfer to CS, whereas the reverse is much more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a snippet of my essay response for the AIF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I would greatly benefit from Software Engineering because it provides a cohort system that encourages teamwork and community. The hands-on training through 6 co-op terms would be an invaluable experience. These two aspects along with the world class education that starts right from day one will serve as stepping stones to my dream.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can tell, SE’s cohort was the major selling point for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/secover.png&quot; alt=&quot;Software cover&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;SE 2019's first Facebook cover photo. (Summer 2014)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-actual-se-experience&quot;&gt;My actual SE experience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-cohort-1&quot;&gt;1. Cohort.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I described earlier, the cohort program was the main reason why I chose SE. Three years later, I can confidently say that the people of SE made everything worth it. If someone asked me, “Why SE?”, I would respond with, “the SE cohort.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All 125 SE students have the exact same schedule for the 10.5 courses. SE cohorts also have a Facebook group, which is a great place to keep up with relevant academic and social events. We have Messenger group chats where we sometimes discuss serious topics, and occasionally post memes about shawarmas. &lt;strong&gt;You feel like you’re actually part of a community in SE.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I’ve noticed in non-cohort programs like CS or Math, it requires more effort to make friends. In CS/Math, there are several lecture sections for a course, so students will be scattered through many different combinations of schedules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the cohort system can help SE students with respect to academics. SE students often study and work with other SE students. This could range from asking for help on a lecture concept or assignment question to crowdsourcing final exam solutions. For me personally, academics would definitely be even more of a struggle without my SE peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/software-study.png&quot; alt=&quot;Software study&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Working hard or hardly working in the SE Lab? (Fall 2014)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another good and bad thing about SE cohorts is you’re surrounded by really smart, hardworking people. Everybody in your class was amongst the top students in their respective high schools. This is good because you can learn from very bright individuals and be motivated to work harder. For some students, this could also be negative. For example, in the SE 2021 cohort’s 1A term, the term average was 85.4%. A student could have an 80% term average (which is excellent), and be ranked in the bottom 20% of the class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cohort system creates a strong sense of community within SE. This past fall, I hosted a Software Engineering social for all SE cohorts on campus, which over 200 SE students attended! This is just one example of numerous opportunities where SE cohorts of different years can socialize and learn from each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/softwaresocial.png&quot; alt=&quot;Software Social&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Software Engineering social. (Fall 2017)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve personally learned how valuable having upper year SE mentors is: they have already experienced the things that I will experience, so they can always provide insightful advice. For example, my friends in SE 2018 have spent the last few months applying and interviewing for full time jobs. By observing what they did well and not so well, I can use their experiences to help me prepare. In addition, if there’s a SE upper year or alumni that works at a company I’m interested in, I can get a referral from them and improve my chances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, to close off the SE community point, the SE department staff are proactive, nice, and very helpful. If you’re ever struggling with something, you can always reach them by walking into the SE office or through email. The SE department’s service to students is second to none. Special shoutouts to Patrick Lam, our awesome SE director! As you can probably tell by now, the SE cohort and community is something that has really made my SE experience so amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2bclasspic.png&quot; alt=&quot;2B Class picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;2B class picture. (Summer 2016)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-co-op-1&quot;&gt;2. Co-op.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waterloo is best known for its co-op program, and definitely does a great job in marketing it. What most high school students (and their parents) don’t realize is that the co-op program doesn’t guarantee you a job. You have to work hard to get a co-op job, and sometimes that depends on a little bit of luck. You’ll definitely hear about the Google/Apple/Facebook glamorous success stories, but you won’t hear about the nitty-gritty details of getting that co-op job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SE and CS students typically end up in the same co-op positions. Two years ago, I compiled data of SE 1B vs. CS 1B co-op employment rates. The graph below shows that the SE employment rate was relatively higher than the CS employment rate (more graphs can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@itsbilal/feel-like-you-dont-belong-at-uwaterloo-computer-science-software-engineering-here-s-why-you-do-f821864e3e06&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Note that this comparison is not apples to apples because there are many more CS students than SE students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/coopstats.png&quot; alt=&quot;Co-op stats&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Co-op stats, SE vs. CS. (Winter 2015)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is being in SE better for co-op prospects than being in CS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My answer is &lt;strong&gt;probably true&lt;/strong&gt; for the first two co-op terms, and negligible in your upper years. You won’t have better chances just for being in SE, but you will reap some of the benefits listed below that will improve your overall chances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SE cohort system helps motivate SE students to work hard and be competitive for co-op applications. When your peers are going to a hackathon or working on a cool side project, you naturally feel pressured to do the same. Though this creates competition amongst students in the cohort, I’ve observed that it’s usually “friendly” competitiveness, rather than a “toxic, selfish” competitiveness. Thankfully, in our industry, there are more opportunities than candidates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every term, there is a SE resume critique event, where SE students can receive one on one feedback on their resumes from upper year students. There is usually a co-op panel where upper year SE students share their experiences relating to co-op applications. Crafting a great resume is probably around 50% of the effort in getting a co-op job. This collaborative, cross cohort event is extremely helpful for students seeking their first or second co-op job. In addition, there are events for coffee/lunch chats, which further provides opportunities for SE students to connect and receive mentorship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/resumecritique.png&quot; alt=&quot;Resume critique&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;My good friend Gary (SE 19) helping Yingning (SE 22) with her resume. (Fall 2017)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you combine the friendly competitiveness, support from upper years, and a strong work ethic, this usually yields great results for lower year SE students. I would say that being in SE does not make a significant difference for upper year co-op prospects, since CS and SE degrees are practically equivalent from an employer’s perspective. At that point, it really just depends on the individual’s skills and past co-op experiences. For full time job prospects, again, I believe SE and CS are equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-prestige-1&quot;&gt;3. Prestige.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve come to a personal conclusion that prestige is a wrong reason to choose a program. Prestige might sound “sexy” when you initially accept the offer, but it really doesn’t matter once you arrive at university. Don’t accept an offer just because the program is very hard to get in to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being in SE doesn’t make you superior to a CS student, or vice versa. Being in SE won’t guarantee you success in co-op or life, you have to work hard just like everybody else and earn it. From all of the full time folks I’ve spoken to, there really is no difference in terms of prestige between a SE and CS degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you come to Waterloo with the mindset that you’re a superior SE student, you’re not going to have a good time. You’ll only worsen the reputation of the SE program as a whole. Admittedly,  there were a few cases of this “bragging show-off SE” personality back in the first two months of 1A. Fortunately, people quickly grew up and matured. For the most part, our cohort is quite humble with their accomplishments, and it’s a very good environment to be a part of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-the-tech-industry-presented-great-opportunities&quot;&gt;4. The tech industry presented great opportunities.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the four co-op terms I’ve completed so far, I’ve had a great time working in the tech industry. I’ve had opportunities to work in major tech hubs like Silicon Valley, New York City, and Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the foreseeable future, I see myself immersed in the world of tech. Your mileage may vary on this one if tech doesn’t align with your personal interests. Reflecting back on my 17 old self’s aspirations, I’m very pleased with the experiences I’ve had so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/friendsnewyork.png&quot; alt=&quot;Friends in NYC&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Friends visiting me during my NYC co-op term. (Fall 2016)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that I’ve discovered about myself is that software development is not the right career path for me. I much prefer the human and design aspect of tech over the nitty gritty technical aspects. Through completing co-ops in product/program management roles, I’m glad that I’ve found a career that genuinely makes me excited. Having a technical SE/CS background did help me land those opportunities, so choosing SE was a great choice for me. I’ve always wanted to go into the education industry, whether that’s a high school teacher or lecturer role. Who knows. Maybe in the future, I’ll give it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point I’m trying to make is that everyone has different interests, and you should pursue the path that makes you happy. Software development and tech is not for everyone. If you can genuinely see yourself in the tech industry, SE or CS both would be excellent choices. If you’re not really interested in tech, I would stress you to really think about what you want: perhaps, SE or CS is not the right program for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-i-was-good-in-math-physics-and-engineering-courses-in-high-school-1&quot;&gt;5. I was good in math, physics, and engineering courses in high school.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This statement is true. I was indeed good in math, physics, and engineering courses in high school. Naturally, I &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt; SE would offer the perfect combination of courses because I thought I was interested in those subjects. After experiencing courses like ECE 105, ECE 106, ECE 140, ECE 124, and SE 380, I realized that I have little to no interest in the hardware and engineering courses. Though some of these courses had amazing professors, it was the course content that I was not interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/greatta.png&quot; alt=&quot;Great TA&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;An awesome TA that magically made circuits make sense. (Fall 2014)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, SE students are required to take courses like CHE 102, MSCI 261, SE 463, SE 464, SE 465, and CS 348. The 11 courses listed above are necessary to fulfill our degree requirements, or necessary for SE to become an accredited engineering program. While it’s understandable that CHE 102 is required for accreditation purposes, it has no relevance to us. To be fair, SE 463/464/465 are very relevant to SE students, but I would rather have flexibility to choose alternative courses than take these ones. I should also note that the SE department are actively trying to improve these 3 SE courses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the bright side, SE students get to take SE 212, ECE 222, SE 350, CS 247, instead of CS 245, CS 251, CS 350, CS 246, respectively. I’ve observed that these 4 SE course offerings are more interesting and better administered than their CS counterparts. SE 350 (operating systems) was the most interesting and important course I’ve taken in university.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SE students also have to work on a fourth year design project. The return on investment of doing the FYDP really depends on your personality and personal interests. I would consider this to be a neutral aspect of the SE program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I had a negative experience with SE’s rigid academic program. If I had a choice, I would not have taken the 11 courses mentioned above. If you think about it, those 11 courses make up two whole academic terms worth of courses that made me unhappy. I would much rather have taken electives that I was actually interested in. It’s worth mentioning that two positive things did come out of those 11 courses. First, it taught me how to overcome adversity and deal with things that I don’t like. Second, the 11 courses built a stronger bond within our cohort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also want to comment that SE students typically have a high course workload, especially during 2B and 3B. I think it’s fair to say that the average workload in SE is higher than CS, due to having to take engineering requirement courses instead of electives. Though if you’re in CS, you could potentially have a heavier workload by choosing more difficult electives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5b-you-can-become-an-accredited-professional-engineer-and-get-an-iron-ring-1&quot;&gt;5b. You can become an accredited professional engineer and get an iron ring.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized that the utility of being an accredited professional engineer is not that beneficial for SE students. The majority of SE students never pursue this designation. Sure, there may be some SE students whose ambitions include being a professional engineer, but for myself, this wasn’t the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/pengjoke.png&quot; alt=&quot;Iron Ring Joke&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;I guess I'll never fulfill this comment.&lt;/i&gt; 😢&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;6-switching-from-se-to-cs-is-easy-but-the-reverse-is-difficult&quot;&gt;6. Switching from SE to CS is easy, but the reverse is difficult.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing this post, switching from SE to CS in Waterloo is easy. In my personal experience, it was a very simple process. I set up an appointment with a CS undergraduate advisor to discuss transferring to CS. The advisor looked through my courses and grades, and then determined a mapping to meet CS requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve provided an unofficial mapping of the SE -&amp;gt; CS courses here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xB0sPpasjcYGaQLO73jXVgaPEUg69zAIbHU9dtc7S2A/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;Unofficial SE -&amp;gt; Credit Mapping&lt;/a&gt; – this spreadsheet does not include 4A or 4B SE courses. You can find the official CS requirement list &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/checklists&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. For official inquiries, please contact a CS advisor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re stuck between choosing SE and CS, a recommendation would be to choose SE, as you can always transfer to CS. The reverse transfer process is very difficult, since SE has very limited space, and you would have to fulfill all the engineering requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;overall-reflection&quot;&gt;Overall reflection&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With hindsight, I have no regrets choosing SE three years ago – it was definitely the correct choice for me. I met many great people through SE, some of whom are my best friends today. This was evident in one of my first blog posts about &lt;a href=&quot;/orientation-week-at-waterloo/&quot;&gt;orientation week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I went to the Software Engineering 101 event and then had a department lunch at Mongolian grill. The food was amazing. The people were even more incredible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My statement still stands true regarding the people, but I’ve since changed my mind about the food quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have built incredible relationships with my SE cohort, individuals from other SE cohorts, the SE department, and SE alumni. The people of SE made everything worth it. These people have shaped me into the individual I am today. They’ve motivated me to work hard, stay accountable, and be humble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized in my first term of SE that it wasn’t the right academic program for me. The program was filled with several courses that I didn’t enjoy. I’ve contemplated switching to CS pretty much every term, but I always stayed because I really liked my SE cohort. Over the terms, many of my SE 2019 friends have transferred to CS. Now, all of them seem very happy and fulfilled with their decisions. Note: the attrition rate in SE 2019 is significantly higher than SE 2017/18/20, so transferring to CS is fairly common in my cohort, but not as common in other SE cohorts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I’ve finished my 3B academic term, arguably the most difficult term in SE, I have decided to transfer to CS. This news might be shocking to some of you, as I’ve been a huge ambassador for the program over the past 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/3bclasspic.png&quot; alt=&quot;3B Class picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;3B class picture. (Fall 2017)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-i-transferred-to-cs&quot;&gt;Why I transferred to CS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After looking through graduation requirements, I realized that if I transferred to CS, I would be able to graduate in 7 academic terms. This opportunity was possible because SE students overload their courses in 2A/2B/3B, and I had an extra French credit from the J’Explore program. As a result, I only needed to take 6 courses to graduate. I have to take STAT 230, an additional CS elective, and complete the depth elective requirement. My timeline in 2018 will be: winter co-op term, 4A school summer term, and convocation in October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;opportunities&quot;&gt;Opportunities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By transferring to CS, I can avoid taking mandatory SE courses that I am not interested in. These include SE 463, ECE 358, ECE ATEs, a societal impact course, and another science elective. Instead, I can take courses that I actually enjoy. Currently, I plan on taking CS 449 (Human-Computer Interaction), three BET (business, entrepreneurship, and technology) courses, and KOR 101 (intro to Korean).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a good feeling 4A will be my favourite term in university – it’s also during the summer, which is always nice! There’s a good chance that my schedule will have no classes on Mondays or Fridays. This means I can plan impromptu 4-day trips to places like Banff or Montreal!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, I do not have to do the SE fourth year design project. I find this aspect to be a net positive because there haven’t been any ideas that currently aligned to my interests and goals. If I did want to work on a project, I can always do it by myself, and not have any course dependencies. In 2016-2017, I helped the &lt;a href=&quot;https://interncompass.io/&quot;&gt;InternCompass&lt;/a&gt; team, so I already have some exposure to the FYDP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be officially transferring to a non-coop Honours Computer Science degree. This means I will skip my last co-op term, which would have been in Fall 2018. I feel like after doing 5 co-op terms, I already have a good idea of what I like, what I don’t like, and where I want to spend the first two years after graduation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will likely begin a full-time job immediately after graduation, beginning October 2018. This gives me a 8 month head start in my professional career, and will continue help me out figure out what I like and don’t like. For example, suppose I start working in NYC, and then after 8 months I realize I don’t like the city. I can consider transferring to California, where many of my peers will be when they graduate. I feel like I learn more at work than in school, and I can also make a bigger impact when I’m at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another advantage is having the opportunity to take time off and travel. To be honest, 7 academic terms with 5 co-op terms in between, with no time off is quite an exhausting experience. I haven’t been to China in over 8 years, so I look forward to visiting my family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My gut feeling tells me to transfer to CS and graduate early. It’s difficult to explain how my mind works, but I feel like this is the right decision for me. I trust my gut feeling in this situation, and I’m confident this is a decision I won’t regret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;risks&quot;&gt;Risks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the opportunities listed above sound great, there are some tradeoffs that I’ve deeply considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first risk is missing the social experience of my 4B school term. Many claim that school is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and rushing it would be a waste. I can definitely see where this perspective is coming from, but I feel like I would be more happier working than doing my 4B school term. Some 4B students have commented that they experienced “senioritis”, where they just wanted to get out of school and move on with their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that I will be missing some of the social experience, but I will also craft new social experiences in my next adventure. I will mitigate some of the missed out 4B social experience by flying back to Waterloo for 1 or 2 major events like GradBall, and my friends’ convocation in June 2019. It definitely won’t be the same experience, but I’ve already accepted that I’m OK with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second risk is having to find and secure a full-time job in the next few months. Some new grad roles have closed their applications already, so the pool of opportunities may be reduced. I can mitigate this risk by performing well during my fifth co-op term at LinkedIn, and potentially getting a full-time return offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In writing this blog post, I wanted to provide my personal detailed insights on SE vs. CS. I explained why choosing SE was the right choice for me three years ago, and why transferring to CS is the right choice for me now. I’m not advising you to choose SE or CS, but rather to really think deeply about what you want to get out of a university program. For me personally, it was the people, and not so much the courses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s bittersweet to be leaving SE, but I’m thankful for all of the people I’ve met and the experiences I’ve gained. To close off this post, I’ll leave a quote from Peter Drucker, an influential figure discussed in our SE 390 class. I’m grateful to have the opportunity to shape my future – I’m definitely very bullish about the next chapter of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>My Gym Transformation</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000///my-gym-transformation"/>
   <updated>2017-11-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/my-gym-transformation</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In late 2016, I started lifting weights at the gym. I had no idea what to expect, but I stuck with it. I’m quite pleased with the results and wanted to share my experiences in this blog post, which I will update every now and then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/progresspic.png&quot; alt=&quot;Progress picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Before and after pictures&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a visualization of my body weight over the year. I weighed myself several times a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/bodyweightgraph.png&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-i-started-lifting-weights&quot;&gt;Why I started lifting weights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why I started lifting weights isn’t very inspiring. The reason was because my friends told me to, so I decided to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-i-started&quot;&gt;How I started&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went on the internet and searched up beginner gym programs, and found &lt;a href=&quot;/https://stronglifts.com/5x5/&quot;&gt;StrongLifts 5x5&lt;/a&gt;. It seemed legit and simple, so I followed the guide and watched the training videos. I signed up for a two month gym membership at Blink Fitness, which was only $25/month. I went to the gym and began ‘Workout A’, which consisted of squats, bench press, and barbell row. The program recommended to start with just the 45lb barbell for all of the exercises. I remember squatting for the first time and being incredibly off-balanced with the empty barbell on my back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back, it was quite a humbling experience… I went to the gym by myself, so it was fairly lonely working out at the gym. I was initially  intimidated by the guys squatting with large plates on their barbell. Or that time I failed at bench press for the first time and was trapped under a 85lb barbell. I tried my best rolling out, until someone bicep curled the barbell back to the rack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most part, I was progressing linearly from workout to workout. I distinctly remember the excitement of getting to milestones such as squatting 135lbs, or upgrading my bench press to a 25lb plate! It was really fun to workout and see my lifts going up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/humblebeginning.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Humble beginnings. (Note the struggles and poor form)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-progression&quot;&gt;My Progression&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First day of lifting weights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/20161029.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;October 29, 2016&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my first two months of lifting in New York, I looked like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/20161221.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;December 21, 2016&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I returned to school, and started going to PAC with my friends. I ate out pretty much every meal for the first two months, and then I looked like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/20170301.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;March 1, 2017&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned how to cook food, and started eating out less. I downloaded MyFitnessPal to track literally everything I was eating. After a couple weeks of tracking what I was eating, I started losing some weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/20170406.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;April 4, 2017&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continued cooking more and more, and lost more fat! Now, it’s the first day of my internship in Seattle, and I decided to “bulk” and gain weight, in the hopes of building more muscle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/20170501.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;May 1, 2017&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After eating a lot of great food (i.e. Din Tai Fung) and hitting new PRs over the months, I gained about 15lbs to my peak weight shown in the picture below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/20170810.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;August 10, 2017&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the month of September, I cooked basically every single meal that I ate, and counted my calories very strictly. In this picture below, I’m at the ‘valley’ of my weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/20170929.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;September 29, 2017&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I maintained my weight throughout October, and I’m starting to gain weight slowly now. For the past two months, I’ve also found an awesome gym partner who lives in my residence. We’ve been pushing each other hard to constantly improve. Can’t express how thankful I am to have a gym buddy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/20171111.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;November 11, 2017&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wrapping up my school term. Found some good lighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/20171206.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;December 6, 2017&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current goal is to get into the 1/2/3/4 club, which requires an overhead press of 135 lbs, bench press of 225 lbs, squat of 315 lbs, and deadlift of 405 lbs. I’ve recently achieved the overhead press and the deadlift numbers, so I’m working hard to get my squat and bench press up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/20180105.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;January 5, 2018&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two pictures were taken 10 seconds apart. Only difference was one light was turned on. Pictures taken 10 seconds apart. Shows you how crucial having good lighting is to abs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/20180121.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;January 21, 2018&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been in New York for a month now. Weight is going up at around a controlled 2-3lbs/month. We have catered breakfast and lunch at work, so I’ve been eating a lot for those two meals, and snacking around during the day. This fills up my calories quota, so I skip dinner these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/20180202.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;February 2, 2018&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weight gain progress is still going fairly well. Getting some inevitable fat on my belly. Shoulders looking quite nice in this photo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/20180307.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;March 7, 2018&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reached 170lbs today, and found some good lighting. Crushed 2 PR’s today. Hit 280x5 squat and 375x5 deadlift. I hurt my wrist two weeks ago trying to unrack the weights from the ground directly to the bench pins, without taking off the weights. As a result, I haven’t been benching or any push movements. I hope it’ll get better in the next month. :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/20180331.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;March 31, 2018&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;routine&quot;&gt;Routine&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/programs&quot;&gt;r/fitness&lt;/a&gt; to read about workout routines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got started with &lt;a href=&quot;/https://stronglifts.com/5x5/&quot;&gt;5x5 StrongLifts&lt;/a&gt; and used that program for a few months, until I wasn’t able to progress linearly anymore. Then, I continued working out 3x a week, adding in some other exercises into my own random program. I also experimented with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smolovjr.com/smolov-squat-program/&quot;&gt;Smolov Jr&lt;/a&gt; for a few weeks to get my bench press up. Next, I moved onto &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.is/2017.01.27-015129/https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5icyza/2_suns531lp_tdee_calculator_and_other_items_all/&quot;&gt;n-Suns&lt;/a&gt;, a 5-day split. After a few months, I switched to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/&quot;&gt;Push-Pull-Leg program&lt;/a&gt;, which had tons of volume. Now, I’m back on n-Suns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned the workouts by watching videos on YouTube, and reading about them online. For most of the year, I worked out by myself, so it was difficult to learn the correct form for some exercises. I would strongly recommend to master the form of the exercise, instead of solely focusing on increasing the weights. I also believe that for beginners, any recommended routine works, as long as you stay consistent and get the form right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nutrition&quot;&gt;Nutrition&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this blog post is titled “my gym transformation”, the biggest transformation was actually my nutrition. I’d attribute 80% of my results to nutrition, and 20% to lifting. As a high school kid, I remember watching videos about “six pack shortcuts” or “secrets to getting abs”. I tried some of those “belly fat destroyer” routines several years ago, but saw no results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown in my March 1 picture above, I was at the peak of my weight. I learned how to cook, and began counting calories on MyFitnessPal. Though it was a strenuous task in the beginning, counting calories became easier over time. Here’s an example of a diary log.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/myfitnesspal.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the month of April, my daily calories consumption was ~2150.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/caloriesgraph.png&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I started tracking my calories, I’ve removed many junk food items from my diet. As a result of learning how to cook, I’ve reduced my food expenses by over 50%!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my most recent cutting phase, I aimed to consume 1800 calories daily. I actually don’t use MyFitnessPal anymore, since I have a pretty good idea of how many calories I’m consuming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lessons-learned&quot;&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-consistency-is-key&quot;&gt;1. Consistency is key.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consistency was definitely the biggest key to my success. In New York and Waterloo, my morning routine was going to the gym around 6~7AM. In Seattle, I went to the gym during lunch time. During these times, the gym is fairly empty, so it enabled me to workout more efficiently. Of course, eating healthy consistently is critical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-be-patient-results-will-come&quot;&gt;2. Be patient, results will come.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can tell from the photos, looking in the mirror doesn’t always yield immediate results. Processes like gaining muscle and losing weight don’t happen overnight. You just have to be patient, continue working out &amp;amp; eating healthy, and results will come!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-dont-skip-squats&quot;&gt;3. Don’t skip squats.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Squats is one of the major 3 compound exercises. Search on Google why you shouldn’t skip squats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;challenges&quot;&gt;Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-finding-the-right-motivation&quot;&gt;1. Finding the right motivation.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every person will have different motivations to work out. For mine, it was initially just to please my friend’s requests. Over time, my motivation and passion for working out has evolved from a “chore” to a hobby and stress-reliever. The 1/2/3/4 plate club is my current goal, and I hope to achieve it in the next 6 months!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-the-journey-was-lonely-at-times&quot;&gt;2. The journey was lonely at times.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe I’ve worked out by myself for 75%+ of the time. It’s a lot more fun when you go the gym with your friends!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-not-eating-out-was-a-big-sacrifice&quot;&gt;3. Not eating out was a big sacrifice.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I saved hundreds of dollars from not eating out, it was a bit sad eating by myself during the cutting phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-i-was-intimated-by-the-gym-environment&quot;&gt;4. I was intimated by the gym environment.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning, as someone who’s never lifted weights before, it was very intimidating to get started. You’ll find that people in the gym are actually quite friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to continue working out, eating healthy, and getting stronger. I’ve made a lot of friends who share a common interest in this lifestyle, and I’ve dramatically improved my time management skills. The past 11 months was only the beginning of my journey. I cannot wait to see what the future has in store for me!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How I got a job at LinkedIn by using LinkedIn</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000///how-I-got-a-job-at-linkedin-by-using-linkedin"/>
   <updated>2017-11-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/how-I-got-a-job-at-linkedin-by-using-linkedin</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week, I accepted my offer to join LinkedIn NYC as a Technical Program Manager intern. In this blog post, I’ll discuss how I used LinkedIn to get a job at LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/imin.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cover photo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Photo credits: Komal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-i-found-linkedin-interesting&quot;&gt;Why I found LinkedIn interesting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been a huge fan of LinkedIn, both the product and company, for a while now. I’ve been a LinkedIn user for 5+ years, and have unlocked many professional opportunities over the years. I also use the LinkedIn mobile app everyday to catch up on news, and see what’s happening in my network. In short, it’s one of my favourite products!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, I’ve only heard amazing things about LinkedIn’s culture. My former manager at Addepar used to work at LinkedIn and always spoke highly of his experiences there. My friends and former co-workers who’ve worked there in the past, have all shared this sentiment. A year ago, I had an opportunity to visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/a-look-inside-linkedins-empire-state-building-office-2016-10&quot;&gt;LinkedIn’s NYC office&lt;/a&gt; in the Empire State Building, and was quite impressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;application-process&quot;&gt;Application process&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I saw the LinkedIn job posting on WaterlooWorks (my school’s job board), it was a no-brainer decision to apply. I applied, wrote a simple cover letter, and even reached out to one of my friends for a referral. To be honest, I was feeling quite optimistic about my chances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several weeks later, I still did not receive a response. On a Sunday night, I was browsing on Reddit (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/&quot;&gt;/r/uwaterloo&lt;/a&gt;) and someone commented that they received a LinkedIn TPM interview. He mentioned that the interviews were scheduled for the upcoming week. Upon reading this, I was quite disappointed, as it meant that I wasn’t selected for an interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/reddit.png&quot; alt=&quot;Reddit&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could have wasted time by questioning why I wasn’t selected or why I wasn’t good enough, but that would not have helped my cause. This job was the dream opportunity for me, and I knew I wasn’t ready to give up yet. I re-read the job posting and found this line &lt;em&gt;“This role will be based out of New York and will be reporting into the Manager in Flagship TPM team who is based in Sunnyvale.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I felt like I had just found a secret Easter egg. I went on LinkedIn, attempted searching for the manager, narrowed the results, and then eventually found the right person. I sent this manager an message on LinkedIn, and also guessed her email, so I sent her an email as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/email.png&quot; alt=&quot;Email&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-and-follow-up&quot;&gt;Interview and follow-up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, I received an email from a LinkedIn recruiter that they wanted to interview me! Later, I found out that one of my interviewers was actually going to be the manager that I emailed. In preparation for the interview, I spent a good amount of time to really learn and understand LinkedIn’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://careers.linkedin.com/culture-and-values&quot;&gt;mission, vision, and values&lt;/a&gt;. I also used LinkedIn to review my interviewers’ profiles, learn more about them and what they’ve worked on in the past. Being an active user and follower of LinkedIn’s product was also helpful during the interviews. I combined  these approaches along with my usual interview preparation techniques. After the interview, I felt really great about my performance, and thought I really bonded with all of my interviewers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I felt really good about my chances, I learned that there were 10 other candidates interviewing for just one spot. The odds were fairly intimidating, so I decided to take an extra step by sending a personalized follow-up email to my interviewers. I sent another follow-up email to the recruiter, and provided transparency about my interest in LinkedIn and indicated that it was my top choice. A few days later, I received an offer, which I eventually accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, this wasn’t my first time finding opportunities through LinkedIn. I actually found my previous internship via LinkedIn by similarly being proactive and messaging a recruiter and manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story I shared today is just one of many stories that highlights the impact of the LinkedIn network. This is why I’m so excited to join LinkedIn! I’ll be working within the flagship organization, which contains the main LinkedIn website and mobile app. Anyways, I’m feeling very grateful and I’m looking forward to returning to my favourite place in the world: New York City.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Unforgettable Summer Internship</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000///unforgettable-summer-internship-at-axon"/>
   <updated>2017-08-27T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/unforgettable-summer-internship-at-Axon</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently wrapped up my fourth co-op term at Axon. As I’m typing up this blog post, I’m on my 19th and final flight of the summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/seattlesummer.png&quot; alt=&quot;Seattle Summer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-i-did&quot;&gt;What I did&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a product manager intern working on the new Records Management System team, which is Axon’s next big product investment. I worked on delivering a solution to support workflows for agencies to customize data fields and reports, as well as the initial design of new report types. I also gathered market and user research for the main incident report that police officers enter data into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked closely with other PMs, designers, engineers, and directors to move the product components forward. There was also a great process to gather feedback from several law enforcement agencies. I had the opportunity to attend 10+ onsite meetings, as well as 10+ WebEx calls with real clients! Overall, I was treated like a full-time product manager. In fact, many team members didn’t realize I was an intern!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was unofficially a part of the Axon President’s party planning committee. I founded and organized the first ever ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/events/458764994503487/&quot;&gt;Software Skip Day&lt;/a&gt;’, where Seattle techies skip work and enjoy a beautiful summer afternoon at Gas Works Park. The event was a huge success, as hundreds of people showed up! Thanks to Luke and Axon for sponsoring the event! In addition, along with the other Axon interns, I helped spearhead the ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/events/200951493772719/&quot;&gt;Axon Challenge&lt;/a&gt;’. Over 100+ interns at other Seattle companies attended and had a great time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/skipday.png&quot; alt=&quot;Skip Day&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fun-events&quot;&gt;Fun events&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axon organized many events for the interns and company in general. Some notable ones included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/axon-grand-canyon-trip-2017&quot;&gt;Grand Canyon Trip&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Din Tai Fung dinners. So gooood!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;GameWorks (think Dave &amp;amp; Busters)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CityPass for Seattle tourist attractions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Corporate suite for Seattle Sounders soccer games&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Team sailing events&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fine dining experience at AQUA by El Guacho&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bubble soccer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lots of ping pong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/pingpong.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ping Pong&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;notable-accomplishments-and-learnings&quot;&gt;Notable Accomplishments and Learnings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I watched the entire first season of One Tree Hill in a weekend.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Similar to airlines, hotels also overbook rooms. I checked in late for a hotel in SF, and got relocated to another hotel, all expenses paid. There was even a treadmill in my room!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t forget to treat yourself from time to time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An 11 inch frying pan is not big enough.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Goldfish (the snack) is a great social lubricant at parties. Bring a bag of Goldfish and people will form circles around you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bias towards over communication.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;T-Mobile provides 1 hour of free Wifi on US flights.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Exit row seats on flights are quite spacious.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t play blackjack in Cambodia (learned from another co-worker’s experience)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;B &amp;amp; H Photo Video is an awesome electronics store. (Need to check it out in person next time I’m in New York)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After long trips, I prefer taking a taxi home over an Uber. I enjoy sitting in the back, and not have to converse with the driver.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Product designers all seem to be awesome people.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Since Seattle is very walking friendly city, I’ve been on the airplane more times than on a bus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/rose.png&quot; alt=&quot;Rose&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;recap&quot;&gt;Recap&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This internship surpassed my expectations in pretty much every category. The work was impactful and interesting, the people were awesome, and the culture was wonderful. There were always events to attend, or people to hang out with. I also fulfilled my goal of travelling a lot and exploring, highlighted by the amazing barbeque in Austin, Texas. Lastly, the summer weather in Seattle was perfect - not too hot and rarely rains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s next for me? I’m going to take the next week off to decompress and just chill. Then, I’m headed back to Waterloo for school during the Fall term. And after that? I’ll figure it out eventually. 😛&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Axon Grand Canyon Trip 2017</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000///axon-grand-canyon-trip-2017"/>
   <updated>2017-08-19T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/axon-grand-canyon-trip-2017</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently returned from the best trip of my life! I spent 5 days at the Grand Canyon National Park for a company-paid vacation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/axongc.png&quot; alt=&quot;Axon group picture &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year, Axon pays for 4 trips to the Grand Canyon, with about 29 people in each trip. While interning at Axon this summer, I was fortunate to be offered an opportunity to attend the trip. I was initially hesitant to go because it was a large time commitment, and I had to wrap up my projects. After speaking with my manager, he was very supportive of me going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-1&quot;&gt;Day 1&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the first day, my carpool group drove from Scottsdale to the Grand Canyon National Park. Along the way, we enjoyed some breakfast at IHOP, and listened to my downloaded Spotify songs, which apparently consisted of 95% Eminem songs. We met up with other coworkers, and gazed at the marvelous views. Our tour guides from Hatch River Expeditions drove us to the Cliff Dwellers Lodge, where we enjoyed a great team dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 1 also marked the beginning of 5 days without cellular access. Being entirely disconnected was a remarkable feeling for me, as I’ve never spent more than a few hours without internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/lodge.png&quot; alt=&quot;Raft day 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-2&quot;&gt;Day 2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We began our 80 mile rafting journey on the Colorado River. To summarize my first time rafting, it was quite cold and wet. Several hours later, we made it to camping site. It was also my first time camping overnight, so I learned how to set up a tent, which we actually never used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the trip, The one thing I was most scared about was food. I was honestly expecting to eat food like PBJ sandwiches and jerky for the entire trip. It turned out that food was one of the many highlights of the trip. The guys from Hatch cooked amazing meals and desserts for us throughout the 3 nights of camping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the night came, I lied on my sleeping cot and gazed at the sky full of stars. It was one of the most peaceful and relaxing nights I’ve had in years. Another notable memory was how the bright shining moon woke me up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/raftday1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Raft day 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-3&quot;&gt;Day 3&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the day before, we rafted down the Colorado River, did a couple of side-hikes, and checked out a cave. It was really interesting hearing the stories from one of the Hatch guys, who has spent over 30 years in the Grand Canyon. We continued bonding as a team and enjoyed great food. My favorite part about day 3 was the warm gusts of air that came after getting wet from the rapids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-4&quot;&gt;Day 4&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 4 consisted of intense white water rapids. Check out a video recorded from an Axon Body camera below. During some of the larger rapids, I genuinely felt like I was about to fall off the raft, though it was insanely fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full video &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B89FOEzS9BZeV011dTYtdjQ2Qkk/view?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (with singing and commentary).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/rafting.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Rafting&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-5&quot;&gt;Day 5&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the last day, we woke up bright and early at 4:30AM. Looking back, waking up that early was a great idea, as the temperature wasn’t too hot during the morning. We began our hike up the Bright Angel Trail shortly before 7AM. After the first checkpoint at Indian Gardens, I decided to venture on my own. Although it felt like there were infinite switchbacks, I eventually made it to the top by 10AM. My motivation for the last 1.5 miles was to treat myself to some delicious mint chocolate ice cream! After my other coworkers made it to the top, we said our farewells, and drove back to Scottsdale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/grandcanyonpic.png&quot; alt=&quot;Grand Canyon Pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the trip was filled with memories and highlights I’ll never forget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shoutouts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hatch River Expeditions for providing an amazing experience.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Axon for giving me the opportunity to go on the trip.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All my wonderful coworkers and the countless memories we shared.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My carpool group for dealing with my questionable jokes and music playlist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>The best $100,000 investment of my life</title>

   <id>http://localhost:4000/the-best-investment-of-my-life</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, I will discuss why UWaterloo has been the best investment I’ve ever made in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally posted here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://uwaterloo.ca/alumni/blog/post/best-100000-investment-my-life&quot;&gt;uwaterloo.ca/alumni/blog/post/best-100000-investment-my-life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Is a degree from the University of Waterloo worth paying $100,000 in tuition fees and living expenses?” This is a question I’ve heard many students bring up, including myself. Having studied at Waterloo for over three years now, I’ve realized why this $100,000 investment is absolutely worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main return on investment of a UWaterloo degree is the &lt;strong&gt;network of Waterloo alumni, staff, and students&lt;/strong&gt;. In my brief university career, there have been numerous moments where the Waterloo network has helped me out. Here are four memorable experiences where I’ve realized the value of the Waterloo network effect first hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-unlocking-career-opportunities-through-the-waterloo-network-of-alumni&quot;&gt;1. Unlocking career opportunities through the Waterloo network of alumni.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the hard work of Waterloo staff and alumni, there’s thousands of co-op postings on WaterlooWorks (formerly Jobmine). I’ve also found great success by tapping into the Waterloo network. During interviews, I’ve heard several times “Oh you’re from Waterloo, one of our engineers is also from Waterloo.” Just like that, I’ve gained instant credibility from mentioning I was a Waterloo student. In my last two co-op terms at Axon and Addepar, I even helped convince my employers to hire UWaterloo students through WaterlooWorks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-building-long-lasting-friendships&quot;&gt;2. Building long-lasting friendships.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through my studies at UWaterloo and co-op terms, I’ve met many incredible people, and built great friendships. Due to Waterloo’s well recognized co-op program there were always other Waterloo students to connect with in the cities I traveled to for work, so making friends was a less daunting task. In ten years from now, I’m certain that some of my best friends will be the individuals I met as a student at UWaterloo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/classpic.png&quot; alt=&quot;Class picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-exploring-the-rocky-mountains-in-colorado-with-a-waterloo-math-lecturer&quot;&gt;3. Exploring the Rocky Mountains in Colorado with a Waterloo Math lecturer.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my recent co-op term, I travelled to Boulder, Colorado to visit my friend Justin, a fellow Waterloo student who was interning in the area. Coincidentally, we discovered that Martin (our former MATH239 lecturer) was also in the area, so we planned an impromptu trip up to the Rocky Mountains. As you can probably tell, it was quite chilly and windy at an altitude of 12,000 feet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/rockymountain.png&quot; alt=&quot;Rocky Mountains&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-diving-into-the-world-of-entrepreneurship-through-the-velocity-community&quot;&gt;4. Diving into the world of entrepreneurship through the Velocity community.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During Fall 2015, I lived at the Velocity Residence, which offers students an opportunity to live in an innovative and entrepreneurship focused environment. Although I didn’t work on a start-up, it was an amazing experience living with other ambitious students. I’ve built strong friendships with many of the people I’ve met, and I’m sure our paths will cross again. In fact, two residents from the fall cohort were named &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160621006214/en/Thiel-Foundation-Announces-2016-Thiel-Fellows&quot;&gt;Thiel Fellows&lt;/a&gt; for their entrepreneurial ventures!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/velocity2a.png&quot; alt=&quot;Velocity 2a picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here I am today, I have no regrets in choosing Waterloo. Thank you alumni, staff, and students for all the work done in building the Waterloo network. I hope you’ll join me in continuing to strengthen the network and provide new opportunities to current, past, and future students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through my four co-op terms so far, I’ve learned so much about the industry and developed real practical skills. Co-op is also a great opportunity to travel to different places, and only have to commit to an employer for 4 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you put yourself out there, it’s very easy to meet like-minded individuals and build a personal network at Waterloo. A recent notable experience was hiking the Rocky Mountains in Colorado with a Waterloo Math lecturer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-&quot;&gt;4. $$$&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of co-op, I’ll graduate university with zero debt. Having spoken to many students from American colleges, the cost of a Waterloo degree is comparatively cheap. Living expenses are also fairly low in Waterloo - you don’t have to pay over $1,200 a month to live on a couch!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;5-an-extra-year-to-figure-life-out&quot;&gt;5. An extra year to figure life out&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people complain that our co-op programs take an extra year to complete, but it’s one of the things I appreciate the most. I’m still not mentally ready for graduation, so I’m cherishing every single moment of the extra year of being a college kid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-i-hate&quot;&gt;What I hate…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-moving-every-4-months&quot;&gt;1. Moving every 4 months&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The possibility of moving around every 4 months makes it hard to start or maintain friendships and relationships. There’s also the dilemma of being off-stream, where you basically never see another Waterloo student due to opposite co-op schedules. Other consequences of moving every four months include the lack of stability, no summer breaks, and the stress of having to find housing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-the-huge-focus-on-academics-and-preparing-for-co-op&quot;&gt;2. The huge focus on academics and preparing for co-op&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a consequence of having to cram tons of material in a 12 week term, and always having look for next term’s co-op placement. It’s not necessarily a bad thing to work really hard in life, but for many Waterloo students, it seems like they don’t have the opportunity to just “chill out” and enjoy the college life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-lack-of-continuity&quot;&gt;3. Lack of continuity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, this occurs due to alternating academic and co-op terms. It’s difficult for student clubs and societies to run very well when people come and go every four months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-lack-of-flexibility-in-academics&quot;&gt;4. Lack of flexibility in academics&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This problem is prominent amongst engineering programs at Waterloo. I really wish I had the opportunity to take more diverse courses, but there’s not much flexibility. I really admire the students at Stanford, who have much greater flexibility and diversity of courses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;5-cif&quot;&gt;5. CIF&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a less serious complaint, but CIF (the main gym) is too crowded for my liking.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to Evaluate an Internship</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000///how-to-evaluate-an-internship"/>
   <updated>2017-07-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/how-to-evaluate-an-internship</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Two months ago, I began my internship at Axon as a product manager on the RMS team. In this blog post, I will share some insights on what it’s like to work at Axon, and also discuss what to consider when evaluating an internship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/axon.png&quot; alt=&quot;Axon &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geekwire.com/2015/photos-inside-spaceship-themed-seattle-office-of-police-body-camera-maker-axon/&quot;&gt;GeekWire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;internship-recap&quot;&gt;Internship recap&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my first day at Axon, it felt like I walked into a spaceship rather than going to new hire orientation. The offices in both Scottsdale and Seattle are the coolest offices I’ve ever seen. To get inside, you need to scan your eyes - this literally feels like it’s from a movie scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my first week, I spent most of my time onboarding: logistical items, getting familiar with the policing
industry and the RMS product we’re building, as well as understanding the team dynamics. It’s fair to say that week 1 was the least exciting week in terms of productivity, but I was off to the races soon after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m on the RMS team, where we’re building a Record Management solution for law enforcement. This &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/axon-gives-accelerate-attendees-exclusive-first-look-at-new-rms-solution-300476367.html&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; provides a good overview of our product. It’s very encouraging to hear from both Axon leadership and real law enforcement agencies that what we’re building is going to change the industry. It’s also incredible to witness the rapid growth of the team - it feels like there’s a new engineer joining our team every other week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite part about working at Axon is definitely the police ride-alongs and on-site agency visits. It’s always fun to travel across different parts of the country and observe the problems police officers are facing first hand. Most of the software I’ve seen at these agencies are around the same age as me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, it’s been a fantastic experience interning in Axon’s Seattle office, and it’s bittersweet that there’s only two months left. I want to spend the second half of this post discussing the 5 factors I consider when evaluating an internship. They’re listed below in order of most significance to least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-to-consider-when-evaluating-an-internship&quot;&gt;What to consider when evaluating an internship&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Meaningful work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think of this category as two parts. First, is the project I’m working on meaningful to the company? Second, is the project I’m working on meaningful to society? I typically compare my internship to a full-time position, with the only difference being that my internship ends after four months. I want to work on projects that are high priority and provide value to the company, rather than “intern projects” that are abandoned after the internship. I also find personal satisfaction in work that solves real, meaningful problems. The work I’m doing for the RMS team definitely fulfills these two criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Culture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I refer to culture, I’m not referring to free food or ping pong tables. I mainly care about the people I work with and the company’s values. What’s the office vibe like? How are the people? Would I be happy working in this type of environment? What’s the work-life balance like? It’s difficult to assess the culture without working there, but I’d highly recommend trying to learn about the company’s cultures in each of your internship interviews. If an interviewer struggles with describing the company’s culture, that would be a significant red flag in my decision. At Axon, it’s a pleasure working with really talented and chill people. Overall, it’s just a very great office atmosphere to be a part of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Mentorship&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an intern who’s typically inexperienced, you should actively be seeking mentorship. This includes weekly syncs, regular 1 on 1’s with your manager, and receiving formal feedback on your work. Your manager or mentor will help keep you on track with your project, as well as teaching you invaluable professional skills. If you proactively seek mentorship, there should be no surprises at the end of your internship review, as you’ll have maintained frequent communication. Mentorship was an important factor when I was considering Axon, and something I brought up to my interviewer, who happens to be my current manager. So far, I’ve been pleased with the mentorship from my manager and mentor, both who I work frequently with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Location&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an individual who loves travelling and trying new experiences, the location of my internship was a significant factor. I’ve interned in Waterloo, New York, and California before, so it was a no-brainer to experience the lovely Seattle summer. Working in many different places have helped me realize where I would want to live or not want to live after graduation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Compensation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you’re really in need for money, I believe this factor is the least significant to consider during an internship. Obviously, compensation is really important, but at this point in my life, learning and building connections is the top priority. You have the rest of your life to make money, so the differences in compensation between internship offers will be negligible in the long term. Choose the best learning opportunity, not the money. Shameless self-plug: check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://interncompass.io/&quot;&gt;InternCompass&lt;/a&gt; for internship reviews and compensation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can tell, I’ve been having a great time at Axon, as it’s checked off all 5 items on my checklist. If you have any questions, please shoot me a message!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Lessons Learned in University</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000///lessons-learned-in-university"/>
   <updated>2017-04-25T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/lessons-learned-in-university</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In this post, I will share the most important life lessons that I’ve learned in university. More specifically, these are the 5 things I would say to a student entering college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/life.png&quot; alt=&quot;po &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-friendships-are-so-damn-important&quot;&gt;1) Friendships are so damn important.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m writing about this lesson first because I believe it’s the most important one. I would not be the individual I am today without my friends. This should be a fairly obvious statement, but I cannot stress how valuable friendships are in university.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Friends shape and define the person you will become.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Friends help with academics, i.e. assignments, projects, labs, studying.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Friends are there for you during stressful times. They’re also there during your happiest moments.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Friends connect you with resources that you would not achieve on your own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could go on and on with trivial statements about friendships, but you get the point by now. Studies in university is already quite challenging. I cannot imagine how difficult it would be without the help of my friends. I travel every four months for co-op, somewhere far from home. Without friends (existing and new), I would be bored and quite lonely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I’m trying to say is from day 1 in university, make an effort to meet new people and build valuable friendships. Try not to always stick with the same high school crew. Don’t always stay in your room and isolate yourself from everyone else. Befriend some upper years, they’ve been in your situation before and can offer valuable advice. When you’re in a new city, go out to the events, and meet other students working in the area. I’d argue that the lessons and experiences you gain from friendships is the most valuable thing you gain from a university education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-its-okay-to-struggle&quot;&gt;2) It’s okay to struggle.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past term, two first year students at the University of Waterloo committed suicide. As much as I have loved my time at Waterloo, I must admit there is quite a competitive and stressful environment here. Every engineering and CS student had at least a 90+ average during high school. When averages for first year courses are low-mid 70s, it’s inevitable that many students will be disappointed. Throw in the additional stress from adjusting to a new environment, and even finding a co-op job, university will not be easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone struggles, even the people who seem like they’re on top of everything. Some people just aren’t as vocal about their struggles, which is reasonable as they want to show the best version of themselves. From an outsider’s perspective, people might think everything comes easy for me. However, that’s not true, here’s an &lt;a href=&quot;/below-the-iceberg-surface/&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; of a blog post where I wrote about my struggles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just understand that it’s okay to struggle. You’re worth so much more than that, don’t let struggles and failure define you. If you’re feeling stressed out, talk to someone about it, whether that’s a friend, family, academic advisor, or counsellor. Surround yourself with people that will be there for you. Also remember that life &lt;strong&gt;does&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; get better, that’s my promise to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-think-about-other-peoples-perspectives&quot;&gt;3) Think about other people’s perspectives.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking about the world from your own perspective and being closed minded will not get you far in life. In fact, it might even be damaging to your relationships with others. People come from all types of different backgrounds and have unique life experiences and circumstances. You should think about other people’s perspectives and feelings at all times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some common scenarios that I’ve observed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You’re in a crowd of people and you know one student was still unemployed. Bragging about how much you’re making would be quite inconsiderate to that individual.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You ask a friend to hang out, but they decline your request since they’re studying. Don’t repeatedly ask them until they get annoyed. Don’t say “Wow that’s lame”. Instead, give them space because midterm season might be quite overwhelming for them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In a heated argument, saying “I know I’m right for sure. You’re wrong.” without a reasonable justification leads to only more frustration. Another example of this is “iPhones suck, why would you waste your money like that? Android/BlackBerry is the only way to go.” Respect other people’s choices.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You say “OMG I did awful on this exam” and then you get a 88%. To someone who’s trying to scrape by with a passing grade, you’re only going to make them feel worse about themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In a group setting, you heavily criticize an individual. Now, you’ve exposed the individual’s flaws or mistakes to the entire group, and have made them feel terrible. Never criticize in a group setting, just respectfully tell the individual one on one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all of these examples, you’ve made an insensitive comment that adds no value to the conversation and pissed someone off. Children think in a one dimensional mindset. We are not children anymore. If you can think about other people’s perspectives, then you will seem like a mature and respectful individual. Applying this lesson will also help you become a much better critical thinker. For example, when you’re crafting a resume, think about the perspective of the hiring manager or recruiter. Or when you’re at work and designing something, you must think in the perspective of the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-stop-comparing-yourself-to-others&quot;&gt;4) Stop comparing yourself to others.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot stress this lesson enough. Comparing yourself to others is a never ending vicious cycle. First, you’ll compare grades, then you’ll compare jobs, income, and overall success. Like I mentioned before, everyone has different lives and perspectives, so any comparison would be unfair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frankly, there’s not much to gain when comparing to others. Comparing yourself to a more accomplished individual would make you feel bad, and it’s very likely there will always be someone better than you. Comparing yourself to a less accomplished individual might boost your self ego, but is that really something to be proud of? Others may perceive you to be arrogant. Finally, you should be focusing on yourself, not others. The only person you should ever compare to is yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this lesson in mind, just worry about your own grades, co-op jobs, and life. Stop comparing yourself to others, as you’re only wasting your energy and time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-time-flies-live-your-life&quot;&gt;5) Time flies. Live your life.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently visited my high school and thought to myself “has it really been 3 years since I left this place?” The four years in high school felt like it took forever, which might have been due to the two 5 month semesters along with a relaxing summer break. Now, my university terms are 3.5 months long, and I don’t have summer breaks. Every four months, I switch between school and moving to a new city for co-op. It’s hard to believe it’s been 3 years already. Time literally flew by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It feels that as I’ve gotten older and become busier, my life is on a constant fast-forward. Because of this, I make sure that I’m actually living my life and thoroughly enjoying it. When I say live your life, I mean do things that make you happy. If you’re always studying, try to let loose every once in awhile and have some fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m uncertain how life will be like after graduation. I’ve worked for over a year through my 3 co-op terms, so I’ve already gotten a taste of the post university life. However, it’s not the same, since I always know I’ll be returning to school very shortly. It’s actually a bit terrifying to think about how I’m closer to marriage and adult responsibilities than I am to starting high school. But that’s something to think about in the future. In the meanwhile, I’ll continue to enjoy every single day before that time comes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of what I wrote about may seem intuitive or fairly obvious, and that’s totally fair. I hope that you will apply some of these lessons in your personal life. To my readers, what are the major lessons that you have learned in university?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>New Year's Resolution Check-In</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000///new-year-resolution-check-in"/>
   <updated>2017-03-31T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/new-years- resolution- check-in</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Three months ago, I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;/farewell-2016-hello-2017&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; outlining my goals for 2017. As March wraps up, I wanted to check in and reflect on how my goals are doing so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/newyearnewme.png&quot; alt=&quot;New Year new Me&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;New year, new me&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year, plenty of people make New Year’s resolutions. Popular ones include getting fit, living life to the fullest, traveling, new lifestyle, etc. This year, I set both specific and generic goals for myself. I wanted to stay &lt;em&gt;accountable&lt;/em&gt; to myself and my friends, so that’s why I’m writing this post today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2017-check-in&quot;&gt;2017 Check-In&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-attend-over-90-of-my-classes-work-on-assignments-early-&quot;&gt;1) Attend over 90% of my classes, work on assignments early. ✓&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every term in university, I’ve said “I’m going to go to class next term”, but failed to deliver every single time. This term, I would say I finally achieved this goal. I believe I’ve only ditched at most maybe 2 or 3 lectures from each class. The one exception is SE350, where I skipped many lectures. I personally learn more from reading the OS textbook than being in class. I’ve also become much better at managing my time, and have completed assignments early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-travel-a-lot-in-august&quot;&gt;2) Travel a lot in August.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal I made was actually to work in Seattle for the summer because I wanted to explore a new city and enjoy the beautiful Seattle summer weather. I’m planning to travel in the two week break at the end of co-op, but I’m not quite sure yet where to go and who to go with. Hit me up if you have any suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-continue-gym-consistency-3x-a-week-new-prs-leaner-body-&quot;&gt;3) Continue gym consistency 3x a week, new PRs, leaner body. ✓&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been consistently going to the gym 5x a week around 7AM, and achieving new PRs. In March, I also began extensively cooking and meal prepping, so I only eat out 2 or 3 times a week. As a result, I’ve become more lean, and cut my food expenses by half!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-seek-mentorship-and-follow-through-with-it-gain-significant-value-from-it&quot;&gt;4) Seek mentorship and follow through with it, gain significant value from it.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t really seek mentorship from anyone this term, though I have an awesome manager for my summer internship. Hoping that he’s a really great mentor!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;5-waking-up-and-getting-out-of-bed-rather-than-playing-with-phone-in-bed-&quot;&gt;5) Waking up and getting out of bed, rather than playing with phone in bed. ✓&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I instantly get out of bed when I hear my alarm now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;6-stay-accountable-to-my-progress-acknowledge-when-things-are-going-downhill-&quot;&gt;6) Stay accountable to my progress, acknowledge when things are going downhill. ✓&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog post is a testament to my accountability. In addition, I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;/below-the-iceberg-surface&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about rough times earlier this year. Overall, this term has been quite smooth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;7-set-aside-dedicated-time-for-productive-time-where-i-must-stay-focused-&quot;&gt;7) Set aside dedicated time for productive time, where I must stay focused. ✓&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can always improve on this goal, but for the sake of measuring goals, I think I’ve achieved this. For example, for this Saturday and Sunday, I plan on setting a few hours from the morning and night to focus on CS341. Yesterday, I knew I didn’t have enough energy or focus to be productive, so I called it a night at 5PM. For the rest of the night, I played Tetris and watched Logan with my friend. Awesome movie by the way!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;8-dont-criticize-others-dont-blame-others-avoid-arguing-less-negativity-&quot;&gt;8) Don’t criticize others, don’t blame others, avoid arguing, less negativity. ✓&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally think I’m a lot less negative and have avoided many unproductive arguments. To my friends, what do you think of me for this goal? On a side note, I’d like to emphasize it’s best to not criticize others. Sometimes, it’s necessary to criticize others so they can improve on something they’ve been doing wrong. Remember to NEVER criticize an individual in a group setting. I’ve seen this one situation way too many times, and it’s not pleasant. Instead, try to criticize individually, and praise in group settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;9-remembering-to-listen-to-others-put-myself-in-other-peoples-contexts&quot;&gt;9) Remembering to listen to others, put myself in other people’s contexts.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I still have a long way to go for this goal. I’ve become better, but definitely not at the stage I want to be in yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;10-get-g2-drivers-license-&quot;&gt;10) Get G2 driver’s license. ✓&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took driving school classes over reading week, a brutally boring experience that ate up my one week vacation. Over the course of the next month, I accumulated 10 hours driving with an instructor. Before the test, my friend Cotapher also let me practice an hour in his car, so shout outs to him! The driving test wasn’t easy, as it was hailing, super windy, and school children were literally running around on the streets. I passed the test, so I’m excited to drive around when I’m back in the GTA!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;11-be-on-time-for-everything&quot;&gt;11) Be on time for everything.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m usually on time for things now, but not for everything. Admittedly, this wasn’t one of the best goals to set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;12-significantly-reduce-my-use-of-plastic-water-bottles&quot;&gt;12) Significantly reduce my use of plastic water bottles.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve only used about 30 water bottles in 3 months. This is a major improvement over last year, where on an average day, I probably consumed at least 4 or 5 plastic bottles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, that’s my progress on my New Year resolutions, though I don’t think it’s the best indicator to track how my year is going. I’m pretty happy with myself right now, but again I’m always hungry to get better, be more mature, and accomplish more things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my readers, how has 2017 been for you so far?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>My New York City Experience</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000///my-new-york-city-experience/"/>
   <updated>2017-02-20T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/my-new-york-city-experience</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last year, I had an amazing opportunity to live and work in New York City. Throughout the four months, I recorded the memories that made my experience so special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/newyorkcover.png&quot; alt=&quot;New York Central Park&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Beautiful autumn day at Central Park&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had previously been to New York 2 times in my life. The first time was when I was 11 years old and touring the city with my family in one of those Asian tour busses. I vividly recall the time when I was in awe of the Raging Bull and the terrifying views from the skyscrapers. The second time was when I visited the Addepar New York office for a week. This was actually one of the main reasons why I decided to return to the Big Apple for another internship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/newyorkbull.png&quot; alt=&quot;Raging Bull&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Me looking awkward in front of the Raging Bull&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Me looking terrified at the Rockefeller Centre observatory&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before heading to New York, I was absolutely hyped to spend 4 months living in the heart of midtown Manhattan. Despite my ridiculously high expectations, New York never failed to amaze me. Over the co-op term, I maintained a Google Doc describing all the non-work things I did in New York. I hope my list can help you generate ideas on what to do or inspire you to travel here. Without further ado, here’s the list!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-top-5-highlights&quot;&gt;My Top 5 Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-worlds-biggest-eye-contact-experiment&quot;&gt;1. World’s Biggest Eye Contact Experiment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back on a chilly October day, I decided to check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/RXq_tlncPdI&quot;&gt;World’s Biggest Eye Contact Experiment&lt;/a&gt; near Bowling Green. Going into the event, I was quite scared. I couldn’t stop thinking of how awkward it would be to look into a stranger’s eyes for a minute. I got over my initial fears and ended up staying there for over an hour. I met 10 new people and learned about their interesting life stories. This was truly an eye opening experience for me (pun intended). We live in a world where it’s typical for us to be more glued to our phones than the people sitting next to us. I believe this event has helped improve my eye contact and communication skills, as well as building more authentic connections with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/eyecontact.png&quot; alt=&quot;World's Biggest Eye Contact Experiment&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-macys-black-friday-sale&quot;&gt;2. Macy’s Black Friday Sale&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always read about the craziness of Black Friday in America, so I wanted to check out the chaos in person. I was one of the first 50 people in line at the world’s former largest retail store, Macy’s at Herald Square. I managed to pick up some sweet deals, though the best part definitely was the energetic crowd of people. Would I do this again? Probably not, it’s a bit too hectic for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/macys.png&quot; alt=&quot;Macy's Black Friday&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-broadway&quot;&gt;3. Broadway&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was in New York, I watched 6 Broadway shows: Les Misérables, Aladdin, Phantom of the Opera, Wicked, On Your Feet, and Chicago. Every show was very entertaining and well worth the money. It was also amazing sharing the Broadway experience with friends visiting from out of town. Did I mention that these 6 shows only costed about $200 total? I got these cheap tickets by entering the online &lt;a href=&quot;https://lottery.broadwaydirect.com/&quot;&gt;lottery&lt;/a&gt; and lining up for rush tickets. Shows left on my to-watch list include Book of Mormon, Lion King, and Hamilton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/wicked.png&quot; alt=&quot;Wicked&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-walking&quot;&gt;4. Walking&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite things about New York is that it’s a walking friendly city. There’s always something going on in the streets, wherever you are, whether it’s food markets, street shows, parades, etc. There are also several beautiful bridges perfect for walking and sightseeing. Despite the busy city and millions of people, I thought midtown Manhattan was one of the safest areas I’ve ever lived in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-friendly-people&quot;&gt;5. Friendly People&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, last but not least, I was very appreciative of the friendly people working at the front-desk of my apartment and gym. Every day presented new experiences and challenges, but the one thing that remained constant was those people. Whether I had a good or bad day, they always brought enthusiasm and positivity. It was pleasing to hear the words “Good morning, Bo” from Myron every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Expanding on to the concept of friendly people, I was thankful for my friends, my co-workers, and all of the new people I met in New York. They truly made my experience unforgettable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/friends.png&quot; alt=&quot;Friends&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-i-did&quot;&gt;Things I did&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;art-galleries--museums&quot;&gt;Art Galleries &amp;amp; Museums&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York City is home to hundreds of art galleries and museums. I wasn’t a huge fan of art, but I think I’ve gained a new perspective after visiting so many exhibitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Museum of Modern Arts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Frick Collection&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;National Museum of the American Indian&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vladmir Kush art gallery&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A few pop-up exhibitions like this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/events/183710228741984/&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bucket list&lt;/em&gt;: American Museum of Natural History, Whitney Museum of American Art, 9/11  Museum, Museum of Mathematics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;landmarks--major-tourist-attractions&quot;&gt;Landmarks &amp;amp; Major Tourist Attractions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you couldn’t tell already, I love parks and bridges!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Parks&lt;/em&gt;: Central Park, Bryant Park, Washington Square Park, High Line, Madison Square Park, Union Square&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bridges&lt;/em&gt;: Brooklyn Bridge, Manhattan Bridge, Williamsburg Bridge, Ed Koch Queensbro Bridge, George Washington Bridge&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flagship stores&lt;/em&gt;: Nintendo, Microsoft, Lego, Hershey’s, M &amp;amp; M’s, NBA, stores on 5th Avenue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-iconic-places-of-new-york&quot;&gt;Other Iconic Places of New York&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Upper Manhattan&lt;/em&gt;: Columbia University, Tom’s Restaurant, Cathedral of St. John the Divine, Harlem, Morningside Park, Washington Heights&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Upper West Side&lt;/em&gt;: Riverside Park, Hudson Riverside, Columbus Circle&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lower Manhattan&lt;/em&gt;: Greenwich Village, Little Italy, SoHo, Chinatown, Battery Park, Columbus Park, Bowling Green&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other boroughs&lt;/em&gt;: Roosevelt Island, Flushings, Jackson Heights, Staten Island, Silver Lake Park&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sports&quot;&gt;Sports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched my first live NBA game and live NHL game. Again, the tickets at Barclay’s Center were quite affordable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Islanders game at Barclay’s Center (my first ever hockey game, ended in overtime)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Yankees game at Yankee’s Stadium (the game ended on a walk-off home run and I chatted with Tampa Bay bullpen pitchers)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nets game at Barclay’s Center (saw Jeremy Lin play)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Watched World Series Game 7 at a sports bar&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bucket list&lt;/em&gt;: Any game at Madison Square Garden, NFL game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;general-entertainment&quot;&gt;General Entertainment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I checked off a lot of “firsts” with respect to general entertainment, including first concert, first Broadway show, etc. I found that being under 21 somewhat limited my experience, but regardless there was plenty of stuff to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Several Broadway shows&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Comedy night at Gotham Comedy Club&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Karaoke at K-ONE Karaoke Bar in Chinatown&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Movies at AMC25 near Times Square&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Snakehips concert at Webster Hall&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chvrches concert at Radio City Music Hall&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Illenium concert at Playstation Theatre&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clubbing event at Webster Hall&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mini golf at Pier 25&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Arcade in Chinatown&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bucket list&lt;/em&gt;: ∞&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;miscellaneous&quot;&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You never really know what to expect in New York City, things just happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Marched in the annual Halloween Parade&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Watched Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree hanging&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Participated in SantaCon by dressing up as Santa&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Office visits: LinkedIn, Bloomberg, Google, Noom, Workbench, Twitter&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Below the Iceberg's Surface</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000///below-the-iceberg-surface/"/>
   <updated>2017-02-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/below-the-iceberg-surface</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve always blogged about my achievements and how happy I was. In this blog post, I discuss the &lt;em&gt;iceberg illusion&lt;/em&gt; and talk about some of my recent struggles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/iceberg.png&quot; alt=&quot;Iceberg illusion&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-iceberg-illusion&quot;&gt;What is the Iceberg Illusion?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we see an iceberg, we only see the the tip, a small part of a much larger or complex unit. What we don’t see is below the iceberg’s surface. Often, when we hear stories about successful people, we naturally don’t think much about the things that &lt;em&gt;we don’t see&lt;/em&gt; such as failure, disappointment, and rejection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend recently shared this graphic with me, and it really resonated with how I was feeling this past week. In the past, I’ve only blogged about positive things in my life, which is what people see for the most part. I realized that I’ve never written about the stuff below the iceberg’s surface. Today, I’d like to change that by writing about the not-so-happy moments I’ve experienced so far in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;aww-whats-wrong-bo-&quot;&gt;Aww what’s wrong, Bo? 🤔&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/badweekend.png&quot; alt=&quot;Bad weekend&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, I tweeted this because it was just a terrible weekend overall. Unfortunately, the next week got even worse. The first year version of me definitely would have been devastated; however, I believe I’ve really matured over the years. Despite the awful week, I remained cheerful and I’m still a pretty happy person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I share some of my disappointing experiences, I want to note that the point of this isn’t to make you feel sorry for me. Instead, I’m doing this for two reasons. First, I want to be more personal with my blog followers, rather than just share the highlights. Second, I want to remind you that success is truly an iceberg illusion. You don’t see all of the struggles a person has gone through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should keep this concept in mind when you read or hear about other people’s success stories. When I was younger, I used to always compare myself to others. I often felt unaccomplished and jealous. However, it wasn’t really a fair or logical comparison because I compared my struggles to their &lt;em&gt;highlights&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anyways, here’s a list of moments that made me 😞 in the past few weeks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Tough luck with some job applications. I had an onsite interview that was revoked because they cancelled their internship program. A similar situation occurred for another company I was interviewing for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Spent 24 hours over Sunday and Monday working on the OS lab. E2-2363 is a room that will not be missed once I graduate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Studied and worked hard, but didn’t get the results I had hoped for. Sometimes school feels like an infinite supply of work, but you only have finite time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) I got rejected to Velocity Residence, a place I loved living in back in Fall 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) I stayed awake at the hospital for an entire night until 7am without cellular access, as I was waiting for a younger student to recover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) Unaccountable in my bench press progress at the gym. Also hurt my neck, so I had to skip a gym session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7) Girl issues. I won’t discuss this point in detail, but the graphic below should summarize it well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/playagain.png&quot; alt=&quot;Try again&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;takeaways&quot;&gt;Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it was quite a challenging week, I’m glad it’s over now. Over the years, I’ve matured to not be triggered by these moments anymore. Of course, having great friends to support me helps a lot! Nowadays, when times are tough, I usually refer to my three personal mottos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-just-be-chill&quot;&gt;1. Just be chill&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay calm and collected. Don’t be angry, just be a chill person. When stressful moments occur, they usually don’t mean anything in the long-term. There’s no reason to worry about every little thing going wrong in your life. Will you even remember it 2 years from now? Probably not. You lost 2% of your overall mark due to an unfair participation-based grading scheme? Just be chill, 2% isn’t a big deal in the grand scheme of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-life-gets-better&quot;&gt;2. Life gets better&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When life isn’t going your way, just remember that things will get better eventually. In moments of panic, it might not seem this way, but trust me on this one, life does and will get better. You’ll go through failures and you’ll learn from them. Am I more confident and mature than the individual I was 2 years ago? For sure, I am. I can also confidently say the same about my friends and fellow classmates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-no-excuses-be-accountable&quot;&gt;3. No excuses, be accountable&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too many times in the past, I would excessively complain about a situation and make up excuses. Although making up excuses makes you feel better about yourself, it doesn’t really solve the problem. When you screwed up or made mistakes, just admit it and move on. Don’t be that person who complains all the time about their problems. Instead, use that effort to be accountable and fix your problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a student at Waterloo, it always feels like there’s an enormous amount of pressure to be productive and to work hard. We’ve all seen those marketing posters with accomplishmentX, accomplishmentY, Google, Facebook, etc. People often only see the tip of the iceberg, so I hope this blog post provided an opportunity to reveal the things underneath the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Farewell 2016, Hello 2017</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000///farewell-2016-hello-2017/"/>
   <updated>2017-01-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/farewell-2016-hello-2017</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s been forever since I last updated my blog. In this post, I reflect on my experiences during my sophomore year, and set personal goals for 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/sunrise.png&quot; alt=&quot;Peaceful sunrise&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Peaceful sunrise in Mountain View, California&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2016-in-review&quot;&gt;2016 in Review&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a brief recap of my 2016:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I was on 14 one-way flights, doubling my previous lifetime total of 7 flights&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I interned at &lt;a href=&quot;https://addepar.com/&quot;&gt;Addepar&lt;/a&gt; twice, 4 months in California, 4 months in New York&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I maintained my lazy habits in school, but gained an appreciation for learning&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I gained new friends, strengthened some friendships, and lost a few as well&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I started lifting weights in October and have been going consistently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2a-school&quot;&gt;2A School&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During 2A, I lived in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://velocity.uwaterloo.ca/programs/velocity-residence/&quot;&gt;Velocity residence&lt;/a&gt;, which markets itself as an opportunity for students to live in an innovative and entrepreneurial environment. Though I didn’t work on any entrepreneurial ventures, I had a blast living there, primarily because of the other Velocity residents. They were all super driven people and they had interests and passions in various fields. I was motivated by them to work harder and succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent the entirety of August 2015 preparing and optimizing for my upcoming internship application process. I really wanted to work in Mountain View, but for the &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; reasons, which I won’t mention here. To keep myself accountable, I decided to do a risky move and &lt;a href=&quot;/jobmine&quot;&gt;blogged&lt;/a&gt; daily about my 2A Jobmine experience. Looking back, it probably wasn’t the smartest idea, but it sure did push me. A month later, I ended up accepting my offer to Addepar in Mountain View, California. I was beyond happy that I was able to set a goal, work my butt off, and get rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/velocity2a.png&quot; alt=&quot;Velocity 2A&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thanksgiving dinner at Velocity Residence&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took 6 courses in 2A: CHE102, CS241, ECE222, SE212, STAT206, and SPCOM223. I maintained my terrible habit of attending very few classes and procrastinating a lot. I often questioned why a SE student has to take chemistry. Though SE212 and CS241 were interesting courses, I still wasn’t particularly excited about the term. The highlight of the term was definitely the public speaking course I chose as my elective. I contemplated switching to CS many times, so that I could have more flexibility with electives, and not take some of the required SE courses. At the end of the term, I decided to stick with SE to the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other highlights included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Going to my first semi-formal in university&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Handing off Enactus presidency&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learned how to cook&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Skated for the first time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Montreal trip with the boys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2APic.png&quot; alt=&quot;SE Social 2A&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;An event I organized for all SE students on campus, huge turnout!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2a-co-op&quot;&gt;2A Co-op&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my first flight of 2016, I almost missed my transfer from LA to SF. Being the young, foolish traveller, I didn’t know that I had to switch terminals in LAX, until 20 minutes before my flight. Anyways, I eventually arrived at the Addepalace (Addepar’s corporate apartment).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Silicon Valley companies tend to treat employees extremely well with respect to compensation and perks. This is something that I feel is &lt;strong&gt;lacking&lt;/strong&gt; comparatively in many Canadian companies; however, I won’t discuss this heated topic today. At Addepar, the Operations team absolutely nailed down the perks part. They provided me with an awesome corporate apartment, which was only a 3 minute walk from the office. Addepar provided daily catered breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Other perks included a fitness stipend, free laundry, weekly house cleaning, and etc. Furthermore, the Ops team were all amazing people and would gladly help out with anything!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From day one, it was clear that this internship wouldn’t be a &lt;em&gt;traditional&lt;/em&gt; internship. In my first two weeks, I think I had over 20 one on one’s, including one with the CEO. The Product team gave me a list of 8 possible projects that I could work on. Looking back, I worked on 0 out of the 8 items on that list. This wasn’t necessarily a bad thing because I’ve learned that, sometimes, the best thing is to not work on something, rather than working on the &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; thing. I determined the 8 projects were not a good fit for me, at the time, because of business priorities, value provided, self interest, and a few other criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After on-boarding, I eventually figured out what I’d work on for the next few months. While I won’t discuss the specific details of the projects, I can definitely say they weren’t “intern projects”. One of the major projects I worked on, RepGen2, was shipped, providing huge value to our clients’ reporting workflows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The culture at Addepar was the #1 highlight of my internship. Addeparvians are some of the most intelligent, hard-working, and chill people I’ve met in my life. Though every company will have flaws, including Addepar, I was quite pleased with my internship experience. It was an easy decision to return to Addepar for another internship, or what some people coined “re-ternship”. I wanted to return for two reasons: the amazing culture and a role with expanded responsibilities and learning opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/skit.png&quot; alt=&quot;Intern Skit&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Me delivering a comedic skit to the entire company at Winter Retreat&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every university student has that period in their life where they’re overly sad about something that’s not really a &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; deal. At the beginning of 2016, that kid was me. Thankfully, Mountain View was the perfect, peaceful and quiet environment I needed in my life. People say that there’s not much to do in Mountain View. Sadly, I agree with them; however, I still had a great time. I had a bike that I took everywhere, from Steven Creeks trail to even biking all the way to San Francisco. I enjoyed all the little things the “city” had to offer: delicious meals at Zareen’s, chilling out at Red Rock, long walks to Walmart, strolling through the RV encampment near Rengstorff Park, In-N-Out Burger, and etc. Most importantly, it was the people I met that made my experience so memorable. By the end of my time in Mountain View, I had peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I normally try to avoid shoutouts on my blog, but I have to make an exception for Rosanne, who was like a big sister to me. Thank you so much for your presence and advice throughout the months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other highlights included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thursday night basketball despite the fact we got crushed every game&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Seattle &amp;amp; Portland trip, being vegan for the long weekend&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Watching Purple Rain the movie&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Company Winter Retreat at Lake Tahoe&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;LA Road Trip, Highway 1 scenic route&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/mushroom.png&quot; alt=&quot;Mushroom haircut&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;The forgettable time of my life back when I had a mushroom cut and gained double digits weight from eating too much free food&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2b-school&quot;&gt;2B School&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New term, same old habits. The usual skipping classes, procrastinating on assignments and cramming for tests. It feels like I’ve told my friends the same thing every single term, “this is the term where I develop good study habits and attend all classes”, but frankly things haven’t changed. I had 6 courses in 2B: CS240, CS247, MSCI261, MATH213, MATH239, and SCI238. For the first time in university, I enjoyed most of the courses this term. I think I’ve slowly developed a genuine interest in learning and academics. The course content has become more interesting to me, especially CS240. Overall, it was a tough term, but felt like the usual term to me. Some of my friends didn’t enjoy 2B, so a signifcant number of them have transferred to CS for more course flexibility. This has been coined as the “SExit of Summer 16”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it was the spring term, the weather was splendid most of the time. In the first week, I hosted a house party, went bar hopping, and attended my first Bomber Wednesday (never waiting 2 hrs again). The amazing weather was the perfect excuse to just go outdoors, walk in the park, and explore places in Waterloo. I joined two intramural teams: ultimate frisbee and basketball. I also borrowed my friend’s Fitbit, gained a new interest in long walks, and was able to lose much of the weight I had gained at Addepar. Overall, social life was great this term. Spring terms are the best!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/frisbee.png&quot; alt=&quot;Frisbee champion&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ultimate Softies: champions of Spring 2016 term&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other highlights included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First time being in Vancouver&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meeting a friend I haven’t seen in 3 years and probably won’t see for another 3&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Going to Art Gallery of Ontario for the first time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tennis with old high school friends&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Watching the NBA Finals Game 7&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Countless games of Settlers of Catan&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The endless memes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I learned how to flip a water bottle such that it lands vertically&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/crepe.png&quot; alt=&quot;Japanese Crepes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;$5 crepes, never regret!&quot; at Richmond Night Market&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2b-co-op&quot;&gt;2B Co-op&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hands down, my second internship at Addepar in NYC was the best co-op term I’ve had. The beginning of the internship was rough, as it was difficult to onboard into the Data Build org. This experience was quite different from my previous internship, where I was working on the more client-facing org. As my manager had put it, “Bo had a difficult technical project with a team that initially had skepticism of his role and value. His work is being implemented and the team he worked with will definitely feel his absence”. Again, without going into details of what I actually worked on, I was able to solve the ambiguous problem I was assigned to. I built great relationships with my fellow co-workers and especially enjoyed being at the office 7AM, and working closely with Data Recon. Finally, the New York City office had an energetic and exciting working environment that I enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/team.png&quot; alt=&quot;Product team&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Our amazing team! Picture was taken before the legendary offsite of the year.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of work, there was plenty of things to do in New York City. Fall is also my favorite time of the year, not too cold, and not too hot. Once again, what made this term special was the people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things I did in Fall 2016:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All of the touristy places (Times Square, Central Park, World Trade Center, …)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Watched 5 broadway shows (Aladdin, Phantom of the Opera, Wicked, On Your Feet, Chicago). Only paid ~$30 for each show, sometimes getting great seats!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Got a haircut from a new barber for the first time in 5+ years&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Watched a Yankees game live. Walk-off home run win &amp;amp; bobblehead giveaway&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Watched a NBA basketball and NHL hockey game live (both firsts)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Attended a couple comedy shows&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ate Halal guys too many times. The usual weekend ramen&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Road trip to Philadelphia &amp;amp; Boston&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One week visit to the beautiful Mountain View&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Walked on several bridges (Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queen Elizabeth, Williamsburg, George Washington, Pulaski)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Visited several art galleries/museums&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lined up Macy’s Black Friday, first 50 in line.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Several EDM concerts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list goes on and on…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, New York City is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; place to be. During this time, I believe I really found myself and gained the utmost confidence. To put it simply, I’ve never been more happy in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/livinglife.png&quot; alt=&quot;Living Life&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Living the dream near Hudson River&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2017-goals&quot;&gt;2017 Goals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2016 was a huge year, 2017 is going to be even bigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some things I want to achieve for 2017:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Attend over 90% of my classes, work on assignments early. No excuses this time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Travel a lot in August (Japan? Singapore? Hong Kong?)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Continue gym consistency 3x a week, new PRs, leaner body&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Seek mentorship and follow through with it, gain significant value from it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Waking up and getting out of bed, rather than playing with phone in bed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stay accountable to my progress, acknowledge when things are going downhill&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set aside dedicated time for productive time, where I must stay focused&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t criticize others, don’t blame others, avoid arguing, less negativity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remembering to listen to others, put myself in other people’s contexts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get G2 driver’s license&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be on time for &lt;strong&gt;everything&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Significantly reduce my use of plastic water bottles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>How to Fund a University Education</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000///how-to-fund-your-university-education/"/>
   <updated>2016-02-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For many students, paying for a university education is a non-trivial task.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/tuitionpig.png&quot; alt=&quot;Univerity education&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several ways you can pay for your education, five of them being scholarships, bursaries, grants, loans, and work. I will explain each of the listed in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#conclusion&quot; id=&quot;markdown-toc-conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cost-of-education&quot;&gt;Cost of education&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my previous &lt;a href=&quot;/first-year-university-expenses&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, I wrote about the costs of university. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/150909/t001b-eng.htm&quot;&gt;According to Stats Canada&lt;/a&gt;, the average tuition in Ontario costs about $7,900, not including additional compulsory fees. And if you’re living away from home, you can expect to pay another $5,000 or more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can tell, paying for university is not easy. For myself, I project my entire undergraduate experience to cost over $80,000. Through hard work and some luck, I managed to pay for my tuition and living expenses without taking a single penny from my parents. After reading this post, I hope that you can apply this knowledge into paying for your university education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;scholarships&quot;&gt;Scholarships&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholarships are awarded on the basis of merit, whether it’s academics, leadership, volunteering, or other types of achievement. They can range from a few hundred bucks to the coveted full-ride scholarships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I begin, why should you trust me? Because I’ve applied to and won multiple scholarships, helped coach others, and I’m on a scholarship selection committee. I’d also like to point out a very obvious fact: you can only win scholarships if you apply to them. This is a major key to winning scholarships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Gather relevant achievements and experiences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most scholarships have certain requirements in order to apply, such as a certain GPA, exceptional leadership skills, strong volunteering experiences, etc. This step is fairly straightforward, so you should do everything you can to become a well-rounded individual with experiences to write about on your applications. Some scholarships also consider your passion for a particular topic or your future potential, so it’s not the end of the world if your resume isn’t quite there yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholarship applications often require these items:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;strong academic performance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;impactful leadership experiences&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;meaningful volunteering experiences&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;overcoming challenging life obstacles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;passionate and creative essay responses&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;demonstrate financial need&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, it’d be great to have the highest marks, but many scholarships only require that you meet a certain threshold. When you’re stacking up leadership and volunteer experiences, I highly recommend to value &lt;strong&gt;quality&lt;/strong&gt; over quantity. It’s much more effective to portray a meaningful and impact experience than several plain, generic experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although some scholarships may specify financial need, it’s not as important or heavily weighted as the other criteria. Financial need is more relevant when applying to bursaries, grants, and loans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Define the type of scholarships you want to win&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding scholarships to apply to isn’t a trivial task. You know that there are good scholarships out there, but where exactly do you find them? What type of scholarships do you want to apply to and win?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let me define the several types of scholarships that exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. National/provincial scholarships for character, leadership, and volunteering&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Category 1 scholarships require essay responses, reference letters, and often interviews. They receive the most applications and are worth the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Target group specific scholarships&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Category 2 scholarships is a subset of category 1 scholarships and requires you to be part of a specific group/organization/culture/religion/etc. They’re more difficult to find than category 1, as their marketing budget is smaller. Due to less competition, they are easier to win than category 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. Automatic university scholarships&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Category 3 scholarships are awarded based on your GPA. Unlike the previous two categories, they do not require an application. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4. University specific scholarships&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Category 4 scholarships are awarded based on strong supplemental forms or other scholarship applications. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5. Essay contest based scholarship&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Category 5 scholarships require a creative essay response or story. They require a high amount of creativity.  Unfortunately, responses written for category 5 scholarships cannot be easily reused for other scholarship applications. Before applying to these, it’s especially important to verify that they are legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;6. “Enter your personal information and share” scholarship&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Category 6 scholarships are more similar to a contest than an actual scholarship. They are well promoted on major scholarship websites. I don’t think they should be taken seriously. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;7. Luck based, random draw scholarship&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Category 7 scholarships are similar to category 6 scholarships, in the sense that they’re usually a waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I’ve won one category 1, a few category 2’s, one category 3, and a few category 4 scholarships. I avoid applying to category 6 or 7 scholarships. I think category 5 scholarships are interesting because they’re fun to write. This is an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mensacanada.ca/index-e.html&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; of a category 5 scholarship, which asks you to write a 250 word essay on your career goals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, it’s difficult winning a category 1 scholarship just from the sheer number of applicants. However, if you don’t apply, you’ll never have a chance to win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see tremendous value in category 2 and category 4 scholarships. Relatively speaking, these scholarships have far fewer applicants. To begin applying to these scholarships, I would recommend to brainstorm any groups you may belong to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I’m a Chinese Canadian, live in York Region, went to high school in North York, interested in technology programs, passionate about the environment, going into an engineering program, parents work at X company, belong to Y religion, volunteered for Z organization, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3: Find the scholarships&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compiling an exhaustive list of scholarships takes up a lot of time, but trust me it’s worth it. Here are all the methods I used to find scholarships during my senior year of high school and currently in university.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. Major scholarship websites&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two major Canadian scholarship websites are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scholarshipscanada.com/&quot;&gt;ScholarshipCanada&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://yconic.com/&quot;&gt;Yconic&lt;/a&gt;. Although they claim to have thousands of awards worth hundreds of millions of dollars, take it with a grain of salt. You will quickly learn that out of these thousands of awards, maybe only 10 are matches for you. From these matches, many are in category 6 and 7, which aren’t worthwhile. If you’re lucky, there will be some scholarships in category 1 or 2 that you didn’t previously know about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reason why these major scholarship websites lack quality scholarships is because they charge the scholarship organizations a huge amount of money. Small scholarship organizations would prefer to spend their budget on deserving students rather than advertising costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a start, I would recommend to check out these major scholarship websites. Don’t solely rely on them during your scholarship search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Guidance counselors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another good reference to find scholarships is your high school guidance office. They actively receive scholarships listings from organizations, large and small. For certain category 1 scholarships, you may need a nomination from your guidance office. It’s a great idea to schedule monthly meetings with your guidance counselor to talk about new scholarships and deadlines. Some schools and school boards also have a database of scholarships, so try to find that if you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. University scholarship office&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of my favorite resource to find scholarships because very few people take advantage of it.  You can schedule a meeting with an advisor, and they will be more than happy to help you. They usually have a database of scholarships, which you can access as a high school or university student. For future and current Waterloo students, check out this &lt;a href=&quot;https://uwaterloo.ca/student-awards-financial-aid/awards/database&quot;&gt;database&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three types of scholarships that a university provides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, there’s the automatically awarded scholarships that you receive for achieving a certain GPA. Second, there are major university specific scholarships that require a lengthy application. Third, there’s the smaller scholarships that require a supplementary application or a separate application. From these three types, scholarships can either be an entrance, renewable or one off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the scholarship office compiles a list of external award opportunities, so that’s very worthwhile to check out. Here’s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://uwaterloo.ca/student-awards-financial-aid/undergraduate-awards/external-award-opportunities&quot;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; from the Waterloo Student Awards and Financial Aid office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4. Word of mouth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your mileage may vary for this category. What I mean by ‘word of mouth’ is hearing about scholarship success stories from your personal network of friends, family, coworkers, etc. If you know anyone who has won a scholarship, you should reach out to them for guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a simple checklist of people you can ask&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;your parents’ employers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;student clubs and organizations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;places you volunteered at&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sports teams&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;church or other religious places&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;upper year/university friends&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;local community centre or library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have a network of support yet, I’d advise you to start working towards that, as it’s super important later in life. When I was applying to scholarships in high school, I admit that my network was rather limited. I didn’t have this ‘word of mouth’ method to rely on, so I had to hustle and self learn many of these methods and build my knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5. Social media&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media is a very underrated medium to find scholarships. To mimic the ‘word of mouth’ effect, I used social media frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Twitter, I highly recommend to follow other high school guidance and district school board accounts. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BayviewGuidance&quot;&gt;Bayview Guidance&lt;/a&gt;’s Twitter account has some really awesome content. Other useful Twitter accounts include student life organizations, youth organizations, professional unions, university student awards office, local media outlets, etc. These accounts post about scholarships from time to time. In addition, I searched terms like ‘Canadian scholarship’ to see what people have been posting about scholarships recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Facebook, I followed several scholarship related pages. Just search ‘Canada scholarships’ and follow the pages with thousands of likes. I also joined several university student groups on Facebook and once again searched for the keyword ‘scholarship’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I followed student blogs and learned how they went through their scholarship process. I couldn’t necessarily find blogs where they posted specific scholarships to apply to, but it was invaluable learning what makes up a winning essay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to go a step beyond, you can go on LinkedIn, search for accomplished students or upper year classmates, and see what type of awards they won.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;6. Google search for specific keywords&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Searching for specific keywords on Google is time consuming and tedious, though very rewarding once you master it. Searching for generic terms like “scholarships in Canada” will return results for the major scholarship websites, who own the SEO for these particular queries. In order to get more effective results, you have to use several, very specific words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, one time, I searched “professional engineer willowdale scholarship”. Then, I found a scholarship that I would not have found through generic searching or major scholarship websites. I applied to the scholarship and won it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also Google search press releases of recent scholarship winners and view their profiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;7. Student forums&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On student forums, there are many high school and university students who post about their accomplishments. I recommend to go through old threads and see what type of scholarships these students have applied to or won.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;8. Large corporation scholarships&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large corporations often give back to the community through empowering young people with scholarships. Brainstorm a long list of well known companies and find out if they have a scholarship program. An additional strategy is to search companies related to your industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I’m in the tech industry and I found that Google, Microsoft and other companies all offer scholarships. Similarly, if I’m passionate about the environment, I might look to companies like Shell who wants to minimize their environmental impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4: Evaluate the scholarships&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After step 3, you should have found several scholarships to apply to. In an ideal world, you could apply to all the scholarships you found. In reality, you probably don’t have enough time to work on all of the applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When shortlisting your list of scholarships, consider the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do I meet all of the requirements?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Am I a right fit for this scholarship?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do I have a &lt;em&gt;realistic&lt;/em&gt; chance of winning?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is it worth my time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 5: Gather and prepare required documents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have a shortlist of scholarships, it’s critical to keep track of the scholarship’s requirements and deadline. Personally, I tracked all scholarship applications on an Excel spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are documents that are &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; required:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;academic transcript&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2-3 reference letters&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;resume&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;summary of your leadership roles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;high quality picture of yourself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend to get these ready documents prepared at least one week in advance of the deadline. For reference letters, be respectful of your referees and give them at least two weeks time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 6: Write scholarship applications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since there are so many scholarships out there, it’s hard to generalize what the winning strategy is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are my top 10 major 🔑’s to success:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Follow the prompt and instructions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Know your target audience&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clear and concise language&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Grammar free and proofread responses&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Research the organization’s core values and relate to them&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tell a personal, meaningful story&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Incorporate real life examples&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Highlight your results and impact&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Relate your past accomplishments to future potential&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have fun while writing :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you have submitted your applications, patiently wait for results. Look for more scholarships, repeat the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final thoughts on scholarships&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As corny as this sounds, regardless of the outcome, you are a winner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Because you put in the effort to do all of this work. You’ve prepared well-written essay responses, collected reference letters, updated your resume, and learned how to find and fill out an application. These are all crucial skills to have as you grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst thing that can happen is you don’t win. In the process, you’ll learn so much about hard work and hustle. You’ll also learn how to push yourself even more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, all you need is a little bit of luck. Put yourself in a good situation and just hope for the best. Eventually, you’ll get lucky and win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the sake of keeping this blog post ‘short’, I did not discuss how to prepare for an interview. I promise I’ll write a blog post about this subject in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On another note, if you’re pursuing a degree that applies technology, I encourage you to &lt;a href=&quot;http://andrewrokfoundation.ca/scholarship-application-form-apply/&quot;&gt;apply to the Andrew Rok Foundation Scholarship&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: I won the scholarship in 2014 and I’m currently on the Selection Committee.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bursaries&quot;&gt;Bursaries&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bursaries are awarded primarily on the basis of financial need but may include other criteria such as extracurricular involvement or leadership. Similar to scholarships, you’re not expected to repay bursaries. Bursaries are typically valued from $500 to a few thousand dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my personal experience, the best place to find bursaries is your university’s Student Awards and Financial Aid office. It’s very rare to find bursaries in other places, since they’re usually classified as scholarships with a ‘financial need’ criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process for finding and applying to bursaries is simple compared to scholarships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Determine if you have financial need&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several definitions to what financial need is. If your total projected expenses are greater than your total income and savings, you have financial need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most bursaries require that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you applied to a student assistance program such as OSAP&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you demonstrate financial need&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you are enrolled in a full-time course load&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Find the bursaries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also a very straightforward step. The go-to place to find bursaries is your university’s Student Awards and Financial Aid (SAFA) office. For example, Waterloo SAFA nice lays out the bursaries on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://uwaterloo.ca/student-awards-financial-aid/uwaterloo-bursaries&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. I wouldn’t recommend to look for bursaries outside of your university, as I personally couldn’t find any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three main types of bursaries for students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. Entrance bursary&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entrance bursary is only available to students enrolling in their first year of university. There’s a simple application, where you indicate some basic financial information. If this bursary exists at your university, the deadline is around April or May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Full-time bursary&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full-time bursary is available for current university students. It requires an application containing your financial information. You may also submit supplementary information such as a summary of your extracurricular involvement and leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. Automatic bursary&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are considered for an automatic bursary from your university’s SAFA office, if you demonstrate strong financial need. An application is not required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3: Apply to bursaries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned before, bursaries are primarily need-based. If you have financial need, you should definitely apply because the applications should only take ten minutes or less. A pro tip is to always include supplementary information even if it’s optional. That extra piece of information can help your cause significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an &lt;a href=&quot;https://uwaterloo.ca/student-awards-financial-aid/sites/ca.student-awards-financial-aid/files/uploads/files/2015_2016_full-time_bursary_application_1.pdf&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; of a full-time bursary application. As you can see, you can apply for a general bursary or a specific one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should consider the following when applying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;know the deadlines&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;applied to OSAP or equivalent program&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;prepare a summary of your extracurriculars and leadership&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;maintain a decent GPA (some bursaries require an 80% average)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll find out whether or not you received a bursary within 6 weeks of the deadline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final thoughts on bursaries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re eligible to apply for bursaries, go for it. I applied to an entrance bursary and did not receive funding. I later applied to a full-time bursary and included a summary of my involvement. The next thing you know, I was awarded a bursary specifically reserved for a first year engineering student.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;grants--loans&quot;&gt;Grants &amp;amp; Loans&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government provides grants and grants to financially support university students. A grant is a non-repayable sum of money, whereas a loan is required to be paid back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three types of loan programs: provincial/territorial, federal, and private.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Provinces and territories&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Financial aid programs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://alis.alberta.ca/ec/fo/pay/loans-grants.html&quot;&gt;Alberta Learning Information Service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://studentaidbc.ca/&quot;&gt;StudentAidBC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.edu.gov.mb.ca/msa/&quot;&gt;Manitoba Student Aid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/departments/post-secondary_education_training_and_labour/Skills/content/FinancialSupport/StudentFinancialServices.html&quot;&gt;New Brunswick’s Student Financial Services&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aes.gov.nl.ca/studentaid/&quot;&gt;Newfoundland and Labrador Student Aid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ece.gov.nt.ca/income-security/student-financial-assistance-sfa&quot;&gt;NWT Student Financial Assistance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://novascotia.ca/studentassistance/&quot;&gt;Nova Scotia Student Assistance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://osap.gov.on.ca/OSAPPortal/index.htm&quot;&gt;Ontario Student Assistance Program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.studentloan.pe.ca/&quot;&gt;PEI Student Financial Services&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mesrs.gouv.qc.ca/en/aide-financiere-aux-etudes/&quot;&gt;Aide financière aux études&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.saskatchewan.ca/residents/education-and-learning/student-loans&quot;&gt;Saskatchewan Student Financial Assistance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.education.gov.yk.ca/student-funding.html&quot;&gt;Yukon Student Financial Assistance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Financial aid programs such as OSAP have fairly standard application procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your family’s combined total income is $160,000 a year or less, you will receive the Ontario Tuition grant which provides a maximum of $1,730 per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on your financial information, the government will also assess an amount of money to loan.
If your assessed student loan exceeds a certain threshold ($7,300 for two-term academic years), then for the amount above the threshold will be turned into a grant, which you do not need to pay back. There may also be other additional grants that you’re eligible for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For OSAP, loan repayment begins 6 months after the student ceases to be a full-time student.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Federal programs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students are automatically considered for a Canada Student Loan when they apply for a provincial or territorial student loan. There are several types of Canada Student grants, which you can find &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.esdc.gc.ca/en/student_grants/csg/index.page&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Private student loans&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve maxed out government financial aid options, the last resort is to look into private student loans and lines of credit, which are usually not interest-free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;work&quot;&gt;Work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final and most reliable way to pay for your university education is to work and earn an income. Getting an job not only helps your financial situation but also teaches you invaluable skills. After having several jobs, I have gained a stronger appreciation for hard work and financial independence. Furthermore, I have matured a lot and feel much more confident finding a job after graduation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most students work during one of these time periods:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. Working part time prior to university&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While in high school, I worked part time at an amusement park, and then interned at a digital software studio for a summer. I think it’s a great experience for students to work during high school to earn  cash and gain some practical experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Working part time during university&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As university students, we’re swamped with course work, so working part time during school is quite challenging. I would avoid working during school, if possible. It’s important to cherish the limited free time we have and reserve energy for academics and other activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. Co-op programs or summer jobs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m enrolled in a co-op program, which means I have to complete six 4 month co-op terms by the time I graduate. In my first co-op term, I worked at a small startup in Waterloo. Now, in my second term, I’m working at a fin-tech company in California. I’m learning so much at work, while paying for my university expenses at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being in a co-op program is great, but it doesn’t mean internships are guaranteed for us. Co-op students face the same challenges as regular students when looking for internships. Whether you’re a co-op student or not, I recommend to work hard and earn an internship at least once during your undergraduate career. Check out my &lt;a href=&quot;/applying-to-your-first-co-op-job&quot;&gt;previous blog post&lt;/a&gt; on applying to your first internship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude, I relied on a combination of scholarships, bursaries, grants, loans, and work to fund my university education. Now, you should have a better idea on how to fund &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; education. I hope I have ignited an idea in your minds or motivated you to work harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you should take away from this post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apply to as many scholarships and bursaries as you can, it’s worth the time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be aware of the financial opportunities around you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take advantage of the resources and ideas I’ve provided you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bo&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/daily-blog-my-2nd-internship-hunt</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I was searching for my 2nd internship, I really wanted to work in California for personal and professional reasons. Throughout the process, I documented my daily thoughts regarding the internship hunt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/rejection.png&quot; alt=&quot;Time flies&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a Waterloo student reading this, you’ll notice that WaterlooWorks didn’t exist back then! It was called “Jobmine”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday September 26:&lt;/strong&gt; Jobmine applications opened up today, and so far I like what I see. I will wait until Tuesday night to apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunday September 27:&lt;/strong&gt; I finally perfected my resume. So far, it has been well received by the upper years and alumni. In addition, I applied to several jobs outside of Jobmine to improve my chances. When you apply to jobs externally, the majority of places don’t offer internships specifically, so I actually applied to full time jobs with a simple paragraph explaining I was seeking a 4 month co-op.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday September 28:&lt;/strong&gt; I began shortlisting the jobs I really liked on Jobmine. I heard back from some external places who declined my application for any of the following reasons: lack of experience (I’m only in 2A), they don’t offer internships, not hiring right now, etc. It sucks getting rejected, but that’s life. On the bright side, one Senior Director at a large company was really impressed and thought I’d be a great fit. He forwarded my resume to the recruiter, so I guess I will find out what happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday September 29:&lt;/strong&gt; After much deliberation, I ended up applying to 27 jobs on Jobmine. Most of them are in the USA, with a few in Toronto. #CaliOrBust? I also wrote one cover letter for a company which required it. Although it took some time, I thought I wrote a fantastic response at the end of the day. If you can’t tell through my writing, I really want this job! Finally, I emailed some recruiters whom I’ve met in the past and forwarded them my resume. I only applied to 27 jobs because these were the only ones I really liked and it would also give me some extra flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday September 30:&lt;/strong&gt; Jobmine closed last night, so the employers received our applications this morning. Some employers are really fast with their interview decisions, some not so much. I would expect the majority of decisions coming out the following week. Nothing really happened today, other than the fact that my friends and I were refreshing Jobmine very frequently!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/uWPick.png&quot; alt=&quot;uW Pick&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday October 1:&lt;/strong&gt; I got my first rejection this morning on Jobmine. I’m not going to lie, but it was actually exciting seeing something change, even if it was a rejection. Later in the day, I received my first interview for a job in Toronto! It’s scheduled 3 weeks from now, which is quite unusual, since most interviews happen within a few days of getting notified. Other interesting news: some of my closest friends got interviews to a very large tech company today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday October 2:&lt;/strong&gt; The day started off with a rejection to the company that I wrote my sole cover letter for. I was pretty upset at first, but got over it fairly quickly. My upper year friends advised me to be patient, since good things will come sooner or later. A few hours later, I received my second interview for a job in California! It’s in less than a week from today, so I’ll probably spend my weekend preparing for the interview. Got rejected by another two US companies afterwards. :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday October 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Nothing happened today. Jobmine and waiting for decisions is actually super stressful. Time to prepare for my interview! Oh, I also reached out to someone who previously interned for general interview tips and advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunday October 4:&lt;/strong&gt; No update. Pro tip: CECA recommends you to use 25 applications for first round and 25 applications for second round. Do not follow this advice. The jobs in the second round are inferior to the first round. I found nothing that interested me. Some friends only found 1~5 interesting jobs that they applied to. I would recommend to use 45~50 applications for first round. You get applications back when you get rejected in the first round, so you don’t have to worry about not having enough applications to apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday October 5:&lt;/strong&gt; Back to constant refreshing on Jobmine. Woke up to a rejection from a company. Just when I started to feel a bit inpatient, I got another interview for a Toronto job. Now, I have 3 interviews and 6 rejections, which is pretty good. Hopefully, it scales. Got two more rejections later in the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday October 6:&lt;/strong&gt; Only one rejection today. From my 27 applications, I applied to about 10ish jobs, which I was completely unqualified for or unrelated to my resume. I thought they were interesting jobs, so I just took a shot and applied. Today, I heard back from a recruiter outside of Jobmine, so I’ll be arranging for a phone interview soon. Tomorrow is my first interview! Let’s see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday October 7:&lt;/strong&gt; I had my first interview on Skype today, and I think I did really well. Skype interviews aren’t my favorite because there’s so much background distraction and it just doesn’t have the same feel as in-person one. Hopefully, I’ll move on to the second round interview!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday October 8:&lt;/strong&gt; Heard back from the external job I mentioned in my September 28 post. Unfortunately, their internship program is very rigid and only runs over the summer. Oh well, maybe next time. I had a quick 15 minute phone interview today for the job I talked about on October 6. The next interview for this external application is next Monday!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday October 9:&lt;/strong&gt; Jobmine finally changed for the first time in the past 72 hours. I received my 4th interview on Jobmine for a pretty nice place in Toronto. I now have 4 interviews: 12 rejections, and 11 active applications left. I heard back from my interview on Wednesday, and moved on to the second round. This interview also happens to be next Monday. Looking forward to a fantastic Thanksgiving Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday October 10:&lt;/strong&gt; Pro tip #2: the number of openings for a job can be misleading. There are some companies which have 40 openings. Don’t apply for this job thinking that the employer will hire 40 Waterloo co-op students. On the other hand, if a job only has one opening, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the employer will only hire a single person. Employers can choose to extend offers to any number of students after the interview rounds, so the number of openings stated on Jobmine is irrelevant. When you apply to jobs, don’t worry about the number of openings or applicants, worry about yourself and how you can maximize your own chances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunday October 11:&lt;/strong&gt; Pro tip #3: a lot of big companies do their recruitment process outside of Jobmine. If you apply through Jobmine, they’ll send you an email about interviews, rather than through Jobmine. They use Jobmine to simply hand out offers and rejections. What this means is that if you still have active applications to big companies after two weeks, it may mean you’ve been rejected already. Obviously, this doesn’t apply to all companies, since some companies are quite busy and review the applications a bit later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday October 12:&lt;/strong&gt; I had my two interviews today and I’d say they both went really well. Hopefully, I move on to the third round of interviews. Happy Thanksgiving everyone! By the end of this week, I think I’ll have a pretty good idea of where I’m headed next term. Oh, another random thought: if you get an ‘Alternate’ interview on Jobmine in the first round, it’s basically equivalent to a ‘Not Selected’ since people rarely miss their interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday October 13:&lt;/strong&gt; Pretty uneventful day, a few rejections on Jobmine. Waiting for emails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday October 14:&lt;/strong&gt; Nothing happened today. In-person interview tomorrow, let’s see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday October 15:&lt;/strong&gt; Had my first in-person interview today, I think it went pretty well. Hard to judge, but hopefully I get the offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday October 16:&lt;/strong&gt; Sigh, no change today. And once again, just when hope was almost lost, something good happens to me. I moved on to round three for a job I interviewed for outside of Jobmine. Going to spend tomorrow preparing and working on the challenge they provided me with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday October 17:&lt;/strong&gt; Pro tip #4: Don’t apply to jobs that you don’t want. Here’s a scenario which happens fairly often (it has happened to my friends). You received one offer or rank, but you don’t want the job. You’re forced to rank the company a 1 to 9. Most of the times, employers will only rank the top few students they like. If the other students who received an offer/rank get matched to another job, then it’s very likely you’ll get matched to this job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunday October 18:&lt;/strong&gt; Midterms + the last two weeks of Jobmine is going to be pretty stressful. It’s also quite exciting to know that this will end in two weeks time (hopefully).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday October 19:&lt;/strong&gt; Only one more application on my Jobmine which hasn’t been responded to. Today, a few companies that I thought were interesting cancelled their posting on Jobmine. A bit unfortunate, but that’s Jobmine for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday October 20:&lt;/strong&gt; Began preparing for the round 3 interview on Friday night. I have another in-person interview tomorrow, though I didn’t prepare for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday October 21:&lt;/strong&gt; Interview got rescheduled to Friday afternoon. It’s going to be a tough next few days, assignments, midterms, and interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday October 22:&lt;/strong&gt; Tomorrow is going to be a huge day, hopefully it goes well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday October 23:&lt;/strong&gt; Today was a crazy day. A test, a midterm, bunch of assignments due and more. My in-person interview for a company I didn’t want went pretty &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt;. The round 3 interview for the job I really want went great, hopefully, I move on to the final round of interviews with them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday October 24:&lt;/strong&gt; Pro tip #5: If you don’t have any interviews or didn’t do well on your interviews, it’s a good idea to start preparing for the continuous round. There’s tons of great jobs there. Some are newly posted jobs and some are jobs which were reposted from the first round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunday October 25:&lt;/strong&gt; Pro tip #6: Don’t be afraid to ask about salary during the interview. It is a legitimate factor for choosing (and not choosing) jobs. Though, for your first few co-op terms, I would recommend choosing the job that provides the best experience rather than the best salary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday October 26:&lt;/strong&gt; There are four more possible days of interviews in the first round. A few of my friends got new interviews scheduled for later this week. It’s pretty bad timing because it’s right during our midterm week. I moved on to round 4 for the job I really want and the interview is tomorrow! So much pressure!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday October 27:&lt;/strong&gt; Had my round 4 interview today, it went well. Time to be patient and await results. Update: Got an email for a round 5 interview tomorrow, yay! This will be the last step in the process, and then it’s either offer or no offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday October 28:&lt;/strong&gt; In the morning, I checked Jobmine and noticed I did not get ranked for a Toronto interview I had last Friday. I’m very happy because this was a job I did not particularly want. This removes the possibility I can get matched to it. I had an in-person interview today with another company in Toronto. It went well, though the type of work didn’t match what I wanted, so the interviewer and I talked about it. I ended up getting a ‘Rank’ from this company, which means they were interested, but I wasn’t their top choice. Later, I had my round 5 interview and it went very well. The only step left is to await their decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday October 29:&lt;/strong&gt; No updates for today. Tomorrow should be an interesting day (Jobmine closes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday October 30:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s all over now. I am pleased to announce that I will be working at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.addepar.com/&quot;&gt;Addepar&lt;/a&gt; in Mountain View, California next term. I was quite nervous throughout the day. I received the offer call when I was playing Settlers of Catan with my friends in Velocity!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>My First Year in Two Words</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000///my-first-year-in-two-words/"/>
   <updated>2015-09-19T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/my-first-year-in-two-words</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time flies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/time_flies.png&quot; alt=&quot;Time flies&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has it really been a whole year since I started this blog? To be honest, my original intentions were to simply update my family and friends on what was going on in my life. I never expected my blog to take off the way it did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m still a little shocked that my blog received over 70,000 views this past year. I’ve received countless emails and Facebook messages from keen high school students (and parents). Although it was difficult responding to all the messages, it was worth it at the end of the day because of the number of people I was impacting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recurring theme of my first year can be expressed in the two words “time flies”. I’ve mentioned this phrase so many times in my blog that it has become a cliche in a sense. I wanted to write this blog post to give incoming students a heads up of what to expect in their first year. This post will be similar to the &lt;a href=&quot;/university-application-important-dates/&quot;&gt;post I wrote a year ago&lt;/a&gt; for senior year high school students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;timeline&quot;&gt;Timeline&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 2015&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orientation week: A relaxing week where the only thing you have to worry about is meeting new people and having fun. Although it costs around $100, I would still recommend going to orientation week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First week of classes: You get to meet your new classmates and attend your first lectures. Some people may find it overwhelming on how different university is from high school. Generally, the majority of the material is high school review until around post-midterms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assignments, quizzes &amp;amp; labs: In high school, teachers used to assign daily homework questions. In university, it’s a similar concept, except it’s assigned weekly and worth a few marks. In some courses, you may also have quizzes during weekly tutorials or class time. Finally, labs typically run every two weeks and have graded lab reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2015&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Midterms: Depending on your program, you will either have your midterms spread out over the span of a month, or in a single week during mid-October. They’re usually worth around 20-30% of your final mark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More work: Hopefully, you will have adjusted to the amount of work by now. Continue attending class and working hard!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free time: There is a myth which states that you don’t have any free time during university. This is untrue, as long as you have a decent sense of time management. During your free time, you can do anything you want! Join a club, intramural, work on some projects, go out, work out, read books, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 2015&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Term project deadline: In some courses, you may have a team project to work on throughout the term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Events: Though events and workshops run throughout the term, there tend to be a lot during October and November. You may interested in checking out some conferences, hackathons, and workshops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;December 2015&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final exams: ‘Tis the season to prepare for finals. They’re worth a huge chunk of your final mark, so it’s absolutely critical to prepare for them well. Your unofficial final marks will appear near the end of December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winter break: This is usually about 2-3 weeks in length, so you’ll have plenty of time to relax and chill. Some people choose to work on side projects and learn new things during the break to prepare early for job applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 2016&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to school: Four months flash by, and now you’re halfway done your first year of school. You’ll have a brand new set of courses, but you’ll still have to go through the same repetitive workload of school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jobmine opens: In my previous post, I discussed &lt;a href=&quot;/applying-to-your-first-coop-job/&quot;&gt;how to apply to co-op jobs&lt;/a&gt;. Make sure you spent the last few months perfecting your resume. In the second weekend of school, you begin applying to co-op positions for the summer. If you are in a different co-op stream, this schedule will vary for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Info sessions: These will be scattered through January and February. If you want to check out a specific employer and see what they’re looking for, I would recommend attending an info session. They usually have free food and swag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 2016&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviews: Hopefully, you will receive co-op interviews. The entire preparation process takes a lot of time and work. Sometimes, interviews
may conflict with your lectures, labs, or quizzes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Midterms: Same thing as before. You should be getting the hang of this by now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March 2016&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Co-op matching: You should find out the status of your interviews by first week of March latest. Most people are still unemployed after the first round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuous round: If you didn’t get a co-op job in the first round, the process repeats again for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More work: Slightly repetitive, but that’s university for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 2016&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final exams: That was another quick 12 weeks of school. A few more final exams and you’ll be done first year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Break: Depending on when your last exam is, you can have anywhere from 1 to 4 weeks of break time until the next term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 2016&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Co-op begins: Yay, you’re on co-op now. You’ll find that the first month of work will have a lot of learning. Personally, working at a start-up, I found that a work term was &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; tiring than a school term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PD course: If you are enrolled in a co-op program, you’ll have to take a set of professional development courses. These take less an hour of work each week, so remember to complete them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 2016&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More productive: You’ll get better and better at work as you’re more familiar with the technologies and project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 2016&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy your summer: Do fun stuff that you may not have time to do during a school term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;End of PD course: Friendly reminder that you have a PD course to complete, if you don’t know that already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 2016&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;End of co-op term: There goes another 16 weeks. During the term, you might have those moments where you just wanted to return to school. There’s also the last week of work, where you are at the peak of your productivity, since you should understand everything inside out by now. The last day of work was bittersweet for me because I really enjoyed my term, but also really missed school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Co-op evaluation: Near the end of your term, your employer will schedule a one-on-one meeting to discuss your performance over the past term. To find out more, check out this &lt;a href=&quot;https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/student-performance-evaluation&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflection&quot;&gt;Reflection&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I genuinely enjoyed my first year at the University of Waterloo. I am extremely thankful to have so many great people and built strong friendships. I had a blast during my first co-op term and gained a clearer idea of what I want to do in the future. Time flew so fast because I was always busy with something, whether it’s academics, side projects, or co-op.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the summer, I’ve matured a lot and acknowledged things which didn’t go so smoothly in first year. My main priority for this term is self improvement mentally, physically, and spiritually. I am currently residing in &lt;a href=&quot;https://uwaterloo.ca/housing/residences/velocity&quot;&gt;Velocity residence&lt;/a&gt; and have already met some incredible, hardworking individuals. I’m also looking for a co-op position for my next work term from January to April 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I wanted to thank everyone for continuing to follow my blog. Your support means a lot to me and motivates me to continue blogging during busy times. I’m always looking for new topics to write about, so please shoot me an email!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>First Year University Expenses</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000///first-year-university-expenses/"/>
   <updated>2015-07-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/first-year-university-expenses</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When I was looking for information about university expenses a year ago, I didn’t get the most accurate responses. Hopefully, after reading this blog post, you will be more informed about the total costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;University is an exciting experience, but it sure doesn’t come cheap.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/tuition.png&quot; alt=&quot;Tuition Cover&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-tuition&quot;&gt;1. Tuition&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuition is easily the largest incurred expense. The costs varies across programs, schools, and location in Canada. The average undergraduate tuition increases by about 3% each year for domestic students and 6% for international students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;View undergrad tuition costs spreadsheet here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/aKML14&quot;&gt;https://goo.gl/aKML14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve compiled a spreadsheet of undergraduate tuition costs (thanks to Stats Canada). These numbers give you a pretty accurate amount that you should expect to pay. All of these numbers assume you are a domestic student enrolled in a full course load. International students should expect to pay between $20,000 to $40,000 for tuition per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programs like arts, humanities and science are regulated, which means all schools in Ontario charge a similar amount of $6,000 - $6,500. Engineering, math and computer science programs should be very close as well, though some schools attract higher fees. For example, York Engineering charges $8,800, whereas Waterloo &amp;amp; U of T Engineering charges about $13,000 (the average in Ontario is $10,500).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professional programs such as business and accounting are not regulated, so their costs vary greatly. I’ve compiled the cost for ten popular programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those interested in a detailed history of Waterloo tuition costs, check out this &lt;a href=&quot;https://uwaterloo.ca/finance/student-accounts/tuition-fee-schedules&quot;&gt;page.&lt;/a&gt; To find your exact tuition, simply google it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-other-academic-fees&quot;&gt;2. Other Academic Fees&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;View other academic fees spreadsheet here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/NTUwA8&quot;&gt;https://goo.gl/NTUwA8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This category includes non-tuition fees such as textbooks, student societies, endowment funds, orientation week, building fees, student service fees, health and dental coverage, co-op fees, etc. The majority of these fees are &lt;strong&gt;mandatory.&lt;/strong&gt; Some fees are refundable, but students don’t usually opt out because 1) they think it’s for a good cause or 2) it takes too much work to get a refund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My total ‘Other Academic’ fees is about $1,170 per term, or $2,340 per year. A large portion of this price comes from the co-op program fee. Generally, students in regular programs should expect to pay about $1,000 to $1,500 per year for &lt;em&gt;other academic&lt;/em&gt; fees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-residence&quot;&gt;3. Residence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;View residence costs spreadsheet here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/kvOsGY&quot;&gt;https://goo.gl/kvOsGY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on your situation, this category could cost or save you a lot of money. For my first year, I lived in a single room at Village One residence at a monthly cost of about $740. I also was required to purchase a meal plan. In general, residences are more expensive than living off-campus. However, I would recommend living in residence for your first year to have an easier time adjusting to university and meeting new people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other option is to save some money and live off-campus. Some places are quite far, so you might have to commute to school. You can either sign a one year lease or sublet from someone else for four months. I would say the average place costs about $500-600 per month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it’s possible, you can always live at home with your family. It’s economical and comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-food&quot;&gt;4. Food&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;View food costs spreadsheet here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/p9w23K&quot;&gt;https://goo.gl/p9w23K&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food costs vary greatly depending on your eating and cooking habits. At traditional residences, you are required to purchase a meal plan, which costs $2,000+ per term. That’s $500/month already! You’re also going to get sick of eating the cafeteria food everyday, so you’ll most likely eat out a few times per week. That could run you another $100-200 per month, if not more. When I stayed at residence, I spent $700-900 per month on food (including the meal plan).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option is to cook! People who buys groceries and cook their own meals spend only about $150 to $250 per month on food. Eating out from time to time will increase this number to $300 per month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most economical option is eating at your family’s home. You can virtually spend $0 if you’re very conservative. Buying food now and then will only cost you about $50 per month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The least economical option is to eat out for every single meal. This can easily run you $700+ per month. I personally fall into this category. I tracked my all of my food expenses (includes going out with friends, coffee, etc.) for a month. Surprisingly, I spent &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; $463 in June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-entertainment&quot;&gt;5. Entertainment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This category includes anything from watching a movie, gym membership, buying others gifts, partying, etc. It is difficult to track this expense, but I would say I spend $50 a month on entertainment. Unless you’re spending well over $100/month, this category shouldn’t affect your total budget much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-travel&quot;&gt;6. Travel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Travel expenses include gas &amp;amp; insurance, bus pass, carpooling, and airplane tickets. I’m fortunate in the sense that I’m from the GTA and don’t have to spend much on travel expenses. I go back home once a month, which costs about $20 round trip. Waterloo students also get ‘free’ bus passes, so I never have to pay for local bus rides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some students may have to spend a significant amount on flying, whether it’s  domestic or international. Some students have to commute to school every day. For example, a TTC monthly pass costs about $100 for U of T students. That’s $800 over an academic year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;7-examples&quot;&gt;7. Examples&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;View real life examples here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/Lxiu7u&quot;&gt;https://goo.gl/Lxiu7u&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get a complete picture of how much year actually costs, I’ve compiled a list of real students’ expenses. The participating students are from a variety of programs, lifestyles, and spending habits. In addition, I’ve anonymized their names. My total expenses from September 2014 to April 2015 was just over $27,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoyed this blog post, see you next time!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>My Enactus Nationals Experience</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000///my-enactus-nationals-experience/"/>
   <updated>2015-05-17T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/my-enactus-nationals-experience</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What a difference a year makes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/enactus-cover.png&quot; alt=&quot;Enactus Cover&quot; /&gt;
One year ago today I was counting down the days until high school graduation. Suffering from boredom and “senioritis”, I did my usual thing and scrolled through Facebook, hoping to find something remotely interesting. Fifteen minutes later, I managed to come across this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPW25D0WQy8&quot;&gt;video.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was probably thinking at the time “Interesting… A 23 minute long video with the title Enactus National Champions. What does Enactus even mean? There’s no chance my attention span is going to last for more than 5 minutes watching this.” Little did I know this video was going to change my life. Anyways, I watched the first few minutes of the presentation and was instantly hooked to their passion and projects. If you haven’t watched Enactus Ryerson’s presentation yet, I would strongly recommend it. I will personally guarantee two things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;You will be inspired.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The line “turning ideas into reality” will get stuck in your head.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After hearing “turning ideas into reality” a gazillion times, I had an idea: I wanted to start an Enactus team at the University of Waterloo and change the world just like Enactus Ryerson. It wasn’t easy, but Enactus Waterloo officially joined the Enactus family in November 2014. My idea would not have turned into reality without the support of Annie Chen (other co-founder), Julie Marin (our lovely program manager), and David Rose (faculty advisor).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team recently attended the Enactus Canada National Competition in downtown Toronto. It was truly an incredible and empowering three day experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/enactus-presentation-team.png&quot; alt=&quot;Enactus Presentation Team&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first day consisted mainly of registration, meetings, and the opening ceremonies. The opening ceremony was pretty damn epic. I’ve never seen that much spirit and passion contained in a single room. We witnessed the first presentation of Enactus Nationals, presented proudly by the Enactus Canada head office team. Simply put, it was informational and quite humorous. Next up, Ricardo Martin, Vice President of Marketing of Unilever Canada, delivered a  wonderful, humbling keynote speech. I was also fortunate enough to be the recipient of Enactus Canada’s Rising Star award. Although winning this award was sweet, the highlight of my night was watching Acacia (from Enactus Thompson Rivers) win the HSBC Woman Leader of Tomorrow Award.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, I woke up bright and early at 5:00AM, so I could commute from Vaughan to Toronto and attend the 7:00AM tech checks. Our entire presentation team actually commuted from home, since we wanted to save some money. Abhishek, Amy, Annie, and Nirupan made up the presentation team, and I was on tech. Overall, I thought our presentation team did a great job. Later in the day, I found some time to watch a few of the National Challenges presentations. I particularly enjoyed Enactus Ottawa’s soccer officiating program and Enactus St. Mary’s University’s Start Up 100 project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/enactus-early-morning.png&quot; alt=&quot;Enactus Early Morning&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it was the moment everyone was waiting for. Brett Wilson’s awesome talk. His speech had everything you expected a great speech would have and much more. The most powerful part of his talk was when someone asked “Who do you look up to in life?” He initially responded with a very influential Canadian businessman (name which I sadly can not remember). He thought about it a bit more and then changed his answer to “someone who spends time with their children and family.” This response left me in deep thought for quite a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/enactus-brett.png&quot; alt=&quot;Enactus Brett Wilson&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday night concluded with the announcement of the winners from the opening round. We were in the last league, so it took a while before the results from our league was announced. The play-by-play went something like this. The spirit award goes to Western, the runner-up goes to SFU, and the semi-finalists are… the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University! Just wow. I couldn’t believe it, though at the same time, I knew we did the best we could do. Having our neighbours and friends Enactus Laurier move on with us made the moment even more memorable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only downside was the fact that one of our members flew back to Korea after our first presentation. As you might guess, this led to some obvious problems. That night, I had to memorize her entire set of lines and then present the next morning. Needless to say, it was an interesting and stressful experience, especially when you’re not staying overnight at the hotel. We presented and once again, I thought our presentation went very well. Unfortunately, this time we did not move on to the finals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/enactus-laurier-team.png&quot; alt=&quot;Enactus Laurier Team&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The four finalists were University of Ottawa, St. Lawrence College, St. Mary’s University, and University of Windsor. The four teams were all well deserving finalists and they all had fantastic presentations and projects. Several announcements later, Enactus Ottawa was chosen as the National Champions, with Enactus St. Mary’s winning runner-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was invited to the Reception of Champions, which may have been the best part of my first Enactus Nationals experience. I had the opportunity to meet many of Enactus Ottawa’s dedicated members and learn from their experiences. I also had the chance to talk with members and faculty from exceptional Enactus programs: Lambton College, Ryerson University, University of Windsor, St. Mary’s University, and St. Lawrence College. I learned from a conversation with Ian Aitken (Founder and Chair of Enactus Canada) that he and Preston weren’t related. He also noted that in other Enactus Nationals, the two finalists are actually led on to the stage and then the winner is selected in a American Idol fashion. Finally, I met David Primmer, the donor of Enactus Rising Star Award. Awesome guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, this was quite a long blog post. I’ve never been more inspired and I’m ready to take our Enactus Waterloo program to the next level. This is going to be one incredible year.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Five Important Life Qualities</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000///five-important-life-qualities/"/>
   <updated>2015-05-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/five-important-life-qualities</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-dont-be-a-dick&quot;&gt;1. Don’t be a dick.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, this is the most important rule in life. Some people may know this phrase as the Golden Rule: &lt;strong&gt;“Treat others how you’d like to be treated.”&lt;/strong&gt; There’s a good reason why this expression appears everywhere, whether it’s your parents teaching you about manners, or as seen in religious texts. Respect others and be considerate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is actually the easiest lesson to follow, but it astonishes me how many people in this world don’t know the meaning of respect. I plead for you to praise this rule because nobody wants to work with a disrespectful individual in academic or professional environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hint:&lt;/em&gt; In job interviews, employers assess both your technical skills and fit with the company culture. For example, you could be the best software developer in the world, but if the employer doesn’t want to work with you, then you’re not getting the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-good-isnt-good-enough&quot;&gt;2. Good isn’t good enough.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I mean by this expression is that there is always space for improvement. Even when you think you did a great job, the truth is you can do even better. You should always be aiming to improve yourself. Try to learn something new every day or go into depth of something you previous knew. If you settle with where you’re at right now, then you’re going to plateau and never grow as an individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re making important career decisions, you should ask yourself the following questions “What will I learn from this experience? Will it make me (or my business) better?” It’s also important to note that competing with others is an awesome motivator to improve; however, your most important goal should be to be better than the person you were yesterday. This is the reason why I love the start-up culture so much. If a start-up doesn’t move fast enough, then it won’t reach its targets or perhaps even get destroyed by its competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-shit-happens-it-gets-better&quot;&gt;3. Shit happens, it gets better.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excuse my language in this blog post, but the &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/D_Vg4uyYwEk?t=97&quot;&gt;world ain’t all sunshine and rainbows.&lt;/a&gt; Life isn’t fair, shit happens. You could be the nicest person in the world, but there are certain things in life which you can’t control. Bad things are going to happen to you some point in life, and you’ll be in the wrong place at the wrong time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must accept failure and unfortunate events as an inevitable part of life. Rather than complaining about how terrible your life is, accept it and move on. Complaining will only drag you behind and waste your time. Don’t drink your sorrows away or wait for that lucky moment. &lt;em&gt;It’s probably not going to happen.&lt;/em&gt; You’re going to have to work hard and put in the time to make things better. It won’t be easy. Just remember that life will get better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-surround-yourself-with-good-company&quot;&gt;4. Surround yourself with good company.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, the environment you’re in shapes your past, present and future. Every individual who you interact with affects your life in some way. You have the power to choose the people you want in your life (obviously parents and guardians are exceptions). There are going to be people who push you towards success and then there are going to be people who do the exact opposite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re in an environment where you are not happy or learning from the people around you, then you should reconsider your options. Surround yourself with good company and make sure you’re with people who can help you prosper and reach your full potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-have-fun-enjoy-life&quot;&gt;5. Have fun, enjoy life.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but definitely not least, have fun! I’m not going to write about this subject because you can figure it out by yourself. Live your life and enjoy the ride!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Applying to Your First Co-op Job</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000///applying-to-your-first-coop-job/"/>
   <updated>2015-03-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/applying-to-your-first-coop-job</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hey world! It’s been a long time since I last posted. I apologize for this delay, but I’ve never been so busy in my life. I can’t believe that first year is going to be over in one month from now. Time flies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I’ll be going over my experience applying to my first co-op job and providing tips to maximize your chances. This blog post will be tailored towards engineering and math students, though students of all faculties can benefit from reading this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/jobmine-cover.png&quot; alt=&quot;co-op&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-1-gather-relevant-experiences-and-projects&quot;&gt;Step 1: Gather relevant experiences and projects.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I mean by this step is to actually do stuff and have content to put on your resume. Getting a job in a field related to your major would be awesome to include on your resume. However, this isn’t realistic for the majority of people, so another approach is to get involved in extracurriculars and student design teams. I would recommend checking out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feds.ca/clubs-section/clubs-listing/&quot;&gt;Federation of Students clubs&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://uwaterloo.ca/sedra-student-design-centre/directory-teams&quot;&gt;engineering student design teams.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Bridges to Prosperity provides civil engineering students with a relevant and enriching experience related to their major. The UW Robotics Team is an awesome opportunity to get involved with robotics. The UW Designed Nanoscale Assembly Team focuses on designing applicable biomedical and nanotechnology innovations for applications such as medicine. Joining clubs not only improve your resume, but they’re also incredibly fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-2-craft-the-best-resume-ever&quot;&gt;Step 2: Craft the best resume ever.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you’ve gathered all the content to stuff your resume with, you can focus on the most important step. I won’t go over how to write a resume, since there are numerous guides online. From what I’ve noticed, the best resumes  have the following characteristics: one pager, clean, concise and visually appealing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a great resume is critical in landing that first co-op job, since it’s  the only thing employers can evaluate you by. The first draft of your resume probably will be quite different from the final copy you submit on Jobmine. It is absolutely crucial to receive feedback on your resume and get it critiqued by others. In September, I thought my resume was great, but clearly that was not the case after the upper-years destroyed my resume with red ink. Also, only write a cover letter if you can write a great non-generic one. Remember that crafting the perfect resume is an ongoing process and improvements can always be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-3-apply-to-jobs-on-jobmine&quot;&gt;Step 3: Apply to jobs on Jobmine.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on your co-op stream, the job application process begins in early September (stream 4), January (stream 8), or May (sequence 4 math students). On the second Saturday of the academic term, job postings open up on Jobmine. You upload your resume on Jobmine and then apply to jobs on the portal. Applying to jobs is as simple as uploading your resume, and submitting your application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most programs, there are usually hundreds of job listings on Jobmine.
In the first round, you have 50 job applications. This might seem like a lot, but it’s actually not. The first round of application closes the following Tuesday night. The second round of job postings opens up the next week and closes a few days later. My personal advice is to use 40-45 apps during the first round and the remaining apps for the second round because the jobs in the second round tend to be not as great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that you’re not limited to jobs on Jobmine. If you find a job that fascinates you outside of Jobmine, go ahead and apply to them! Several of my friends did this and have had success. For programs where there is a low supply of jobs, I would strongly recommend considering this route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-4-nail-your-interviews&quot;&gt;Step 4: Nail your interviews.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviews may start as early as the fourth Monday of the term and end on the eighth Thursday of the term. They may either be in person, Skype, or on the phone. All interviews will take place at the Tatham centre, unless otherwise specified. For the majority of the jobs, employers will only conduct one interview. Some employers may send you a coding challenge to do online or in person to determine if you’re fit for another interview. For the U.S. jobs, you can pretty much expect a multistage interview process. In general, interviews are typically around 30 minutes long, though they can range anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour. For technical interview preparation, I would recommend ‘Cracking the Coding Interview’ by Gayle McDowell. Another helpful resource is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hackerrank.com/&quot;&gt;HackerRank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my personal experience with interviews, I’ve noticed a general structure. In the first 5 minutes, you usually introduce yourself and tell them a little about yourself, your passions and the technologies you’ve worked with. Then, the employer will talk about their own company for the next 5-10 minutes. Next up is the technical interview questions, spanning roughly 15-20 minutes. This could be a straight up coding or a “how would you solve this” question. Or, it could be a review of your resume, and asking you specific questions about your experiences and projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For non-coding interviews, the 15-20 minute portion of the interview is mainly behavioural questions. A sample question could be “tell me about your experience and proficiency working with AutoCAD”. The employer usually asks type of questions to determine if you’re a good problem solver and to assess if you’re a right fit for the team. Finally, the interview concludes with you asking questions to the employer. Always come up with one or two good questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key tip for interviews is be confident and don’t think of the interview as “OMG will they accept me?” Instead, think of the interview as a more formal conversation with your future coworkers. They selected you for an interview for a reason, don’t undersell yourself. Interviewers aren’t trying to make your life miserable by giving you hard questions, they’re just looking for someone they can work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-5-rankings&quot;&gt;Step 5: Rankings.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, by this point, you’ve had a couple of interviews and walked out of them happy. On the eighth Friday of the term, rankings open up. The three possibilities are: offer, ranked, or not ranked. If it’s an offer, congratulations! If it’s ‘not ranked’, that means the employer did not select you. If your status is ‘ranked’, then that means the employer wanted you, but you were not their top ranked applicant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have until the following Monday morning to submit your rankings. You can rank the employers anywhere between 1 to 9, with ranking 1 meaning you want them. To secure a job offer, simply rank ‘1’ to the employer that gave you an offer. Give the other employers ranks that are not a ‘1’. If you weren’t ranked for any jobs, then you’re out of luck and will have to go to the continuous round. If you were ranked for jobs, then you’ll have to decide and strategize how to rank them. Note that it is possible to get matched with a job even if you ranked them a 9, so apply to jobs carefully. You do not want to be matched up with a job that you don’t want (it creates a lot of problems).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-6-job-matching&quot;&gt;Step 6: Job matching.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jobmine will apply an algorithm to determine how the rankings will be dealt with. To read more about the specific details, please read &lt;a href=&quot;https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/get-hired/ranking-matching&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; by CECA. You will find out on the Monday afternoon which job you were matched to. If you got matched with a job, then this is the end of the guide for you. Congratulations, I hope you enjoy your first co-op experience. If you still don’t have a job, then proceed to Step 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-7-continuous-round&quot;&gt;Step 7: Continuous round.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The continuous round begins the ninth Wednesday of the term and goes on until you have successfully found a job. Don’t be shocked or saddened if you have to go to the continuous round. In fact, only about one third of the students in Engineering and Mathematics are employed after the first round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The continuous round functions pretty much the same way as the first round. You apply to jobs and do the typical interviews. The only twist is that rankings come out every Tuesday and Thursday night, rather than just once during the first round. Matches come out Wednesday and Friday mornings, so hopefully you have been matched up with a job by now. If not, don’t give up and keep on persevering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you happen to be without a job after the first month of the co-op term, it’s not the end of the world. You still have 4 more weeks to find a job. Even if you don’t, you can use the time to focus on self improvement and gather relevant experience and projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-personal-experience-and-thoughts&quot;&gt;My personal experience and thoughts.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My experience with Jobmine has been exactly what I expected from the start: a lot of fun and stress. I worked on personal projects and did most of the things I mentioned in Step 1. I developed the first draft of my resume in September 2014, and continued improving it, until I was finally satisfied. I submitted ‘BoPengResumeV6.pdf’ to Jobmine on Saturday January 17th, 2015 and proceeded to Step 3. I had a very ambitious mindset, applying to several jobs in California and most of senior level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first round, I received 3 interviews. The first was for a large company in Seattle, though admittedly I got wrecked in the phone interview. The second was an established company based in Waterloo. The competition for this job was tough and I was not as prepared for the interviews as I should have been. My last interview was for another senior level job in Waterloo, where I was competing with upper-year students with multiple co-op experiences under their belt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was not ranked by all three employers which made me feel a bit sad. My upper-year friends advised me that the continuous round would an amazing opportunity for me, so I was quite optimistic about the future. I revamped to a new, cleaner, more elegant design. Then, I uploaded ‘BoPengResumeV7.pdf’ on Jobmine on March 4th, 2015 and applied to about 130 more jobs. The next thing you know, I get several interviews during the first week alone. I am pleased to announce that I will be working at Bidvine as a Software Developer for the Spring 2015 term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude, getting that first co-op job is not an easy task. As I’m writing this post, most programs currently have employment rates of less than 50%. However, the SE class last year had a final employment rate of 99.3%. What this means is that most students will find a job in the next few weeks. The entire co-op application process is not as pretty as advertised and many students struggle to find suitable jobs. If you follow my advice, then you can optimize your chances of getting that first co-op job.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to Write a Great AIF</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000///how-to-write-a-great-aif/"/>
   <updated>2014-12-24T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/how-to-write-a-great-aif</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For most programs at Waterloo, it is strongly recommended to fill out the admission information form (AIF). By the end of this post, you guys will learn how the AIF may be the difference between an offer and rejection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/aif-cover.png&quot; alt=&quot;aif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 2018 update:&lt;/strong&gt; Check out my new up-to-date post on &lt;a href=&quot;/how-to-get-into-waterloo-engineering&quot;&gt;‘How to get into Waterloo Engineering.’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-story&quot;&gt;My Story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I applied to Waterloo and submitted my AIF exactly one year ago. Two months later, I received an offer to my top ranked program in the “early” round of Waterloo Engineering offers. In this round, about 30% of the offers were handed out and Software Engineering applicants had averages of mid-high 90’s. For example, one of my friends had a 97% average, but did not receive an early offer. Although my average was 3-4% lower than his, I was admitted into the program. This example just shows how important the AIF can be. A few months later, I was awarded a Waterloo Faculty of Engineering scholarship, on the basis of strong grades and AIF. Had I not spent so much time and effort on my AIF, I probably wouldn’t have received an early offer or an additional scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just take a look at the graph below (taken from Professor Bill Anderson’s blog). Over 1300 applicants with 90% average were not offered admission. In an age where applicants all have excellent grades, writing a great AIF is the best way to differentiate yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/aif-unadmitted.png&quot; alt=&quot;aif unadmitted&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By now, you guys are probably convinced that the AIF is crucial for a successful application. I’ll briefly go over the components of the AIF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;components-of-the-aif&quot;&gt;Components of the AIF&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will have to fill out the first three sections of the AIF and any additional sections required by the program you’re applying to. Engineering students have to fill out the Engineering section and Math students have to fill out the Math section. If you’re applying to multiple programs at Waterloo, you only need to complete one AIF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part A:&lt;/strong&gt; You write a short essay response about why you’re applying to Waterloo and why you’re interested in your specific programs. It has a 900 character limit, which is about 140 words. In addition, you list your extracurricular activities (with an optional section to further explain what you did), employment and volunteer history, and past accomplishments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part B:&lt;/strong&gt; This is where you talk about any special circumstances which may have affected your academic performance (note: this is optional). There’s also space at the bottom to add any additional information about yourself. Most people choose to leave this question blank. For myself, I talked about my shadow day experience at Waterloo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part C:&lt;/strong&gt; Basically fill in information about your courses and grades. If you’ve taken courses outside of your day school such as in night school, summer school, online, or a private school, you’ll have to provide a reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engineering Section:&lt;/strong&gt; The first question asks you to write about your Engineering interests and goals, and the second question asks you to write about a book you particularly enjoyed. If you have applied to Software Engineering or you have listed it as an alternate, you’re required to write about your programming experience. Note: taking a high school programming course is sufficient. If you’re interested in being considered for an Engineering scholarship, tick off the box. Finally, you can list up to two alternate Engineering programs. For more information about alternate offers, read &lt;a href=&quot;https://profbillanderson.wordpress.com/2014/05/08/considering-an-alternate-offer-2014/&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Math Section:&lt;/strong&gt; The math section is focused on your past and future math and computing contest scores. It also asks for reference information from a Senior mathematics teacher. As the website states, your teacher does not have to do anything at this time, but may be contacted by admissions personnel to provide a reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;aif-grading&quot;&gt;AIF Grading&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor Bill Anderson wrote about the process and scoring of the AIF, so check out his post &lt;a href=&quot;https://profbillanderson.wordpress.com/2014/01/04/scoring-your-aif/&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tips--strategy&quot;&gt;Tips &amp;amp; Strategy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Before writing the AIF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Research about the University of Waterloo and your program.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Attend the open houses and outreach events (see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering-student-ambassadors/shadow-program&quot;&gt;Shadow Day program&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Talk to your teachers, current Waterloo students, and alumni.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Compile a list of all your activities and accomplishments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;While writing the AIF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write personal responses.&lt;/strong&gt; Last year alone, there were 10,000 AIF’s to be read by the Faculty of Engineering. If you write something generic, your application will be just like the others. Pretend you receive a Christmas card from someone. Would you be more impressed if it said “Happy holidays, hope you had a great year!” or if it included something personal like “I’m so glad to have met you this year. Remember that time when we went skating together… Good times.” Demonstrate to the reader that you have put in a lot of thought and effort in writing a personal response. Don’t be generic.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be passionate and genuine.&lt;/strong&gt; Explain to the reader why you want to study at Waterloo so badly. What makes you so passionate about the University of Waterloo? For me, it was the boundless opportunities to grow and learn. If you’ve done extracurricular activities outside of school, make sure that you highlight them and show off how passionate you are. For the reading interest question, choose something that you really enjoyed. It doesn’t necessarily have to be engineering related. Trust me on this one, AIF readers enjoy reading about passionate people. Of course, be genuine in your responses and don’t write fraudulent statements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check out the profiles of current students.&lt;/strong&gt; You can view the Engineering Ambassadors’ profiles here. Take a look at what current students are saying about their programs and their experiences at the University of Waterloo. Their profiles reveal more reasons why Waterloo is so awesome and you can even draw in ideas and inspiration from them. I would highly recommend learning from their responses and somehow incorporating that into your AIF.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Master the fundamentals.&lt;/strong&gt; What I mean by this is make sure your responses are well-written and grammatically correct. When writing your responses, I would recommend saving them on a Word document. The amount of times I’ve heard “OMG, I have to restart my AIF” is ridiculously high. Submit your AIF before the deadline (I recommend even earlier). Be honest, don’t make stuff up. If you get caught, say goodbye to Waterloo.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember who the reader is.&lt;/strong&gt; Too often, people write excellent responses, but they forget their target audience. The main purpose of the AIF is to convince the admission officer that you deserve to be at the University of Waterloo. How can you convince them? First, you have to demonstrate that you’re genuinely interested in studying here (hint: see Part A, question 1). Show them that you’ve done your research about the university and your specific program. Second, you have to prove to them that you would be prepared for co-op job applications. This is where your extracurriculars, employment background, and special awards come in. If you have tons of activities and awards, make sure that you communicate it effectively. If you’re lacking in this department, don’t worry, it’s not too late to get involved. As for filling out the form, you can come up with creative answers that demonstrate your interest in activities outside of school. You can also use the additional 600 character response to write about stuff that you would take on in the future. Lastly, you have to convince them that you have a desire to grow. Keep in mind that the University of Waterloo ranks number one in producing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://uwaterloo.ca/science/news/macleans-ranks-university-waterloo-best-overall-canada&quot;&gt;Leaders of Tomorrow.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After completing the AIF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proofread your application, it should be flawless.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ask your peers, family, and teachers to read over your application.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hope for the best. If you did the best you could do, that’s all that matters at the end of the day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the AIF readers don’t have this preconceived notion of what the perfect responses and extracurriculars are. They’re simply looking for applicants who are well-rounded, demonstrate passion and interest in the University of Waterloo, and have the potential to grow. In addition, the applicant must have great communication skills. If your average isn’t the best, a great AIF can potentially get you an admission offer. If you have great marks, the AIF can further optimize your chances. The AIF might even make you a &lt;a href=&quot;https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Entrance-Scholarships-and-Awards-for-Engineering&quot;&gt;couple thousand dollars richer.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I know I’ve said this a million times already, but time flies in university. I remember after the second week of school, I was calculating what 2 divided by 13 was in my head. The answer? 15% of the way through 1A. I still find it hard to believe how that was three whole months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve had a fair share of good and bad experiences throughout the term (mostly positive ones, but humans tend to focus on the negative events more). Let’s take a stroll down memory lane…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/village1.png&quot; alt=&quot;village one&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;first-two-months-at-waterloo&quot;&gt;First two months at Waterloo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/residence-move-in-day&quot;&gt;Moving into residence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/orientation-week-at-waterloo&quot;&gt;orientation week&lt;/a&gt; were amazing life experiences. It’s hard to describe the feeling in words, so you’ll have to trust me on this one. I highly recommend you to participate in these activities! &lt;a href=&quot;/first-month-of-waterloo-engineering&quot;&gt;The first month of Waterloo Engineering&lt;/a&gt; was an incredible experience as well. You can also read about my &lt;a href=&quot;/halfway-through-1a-waterloo-engineering&quot;&gt;midway post.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;engineering-ambassador-and-outreach-events&quot;&gt;Engineering Ambassador and outreach events&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;November was a great month, beginning with the &lt;a href=&quot;/waterloo-open-house-fall-2014&quot;&gt;Waterloo Fall Open House.&lt;/a&gt; I enjoyed talking with prospective students and answering their questions. The most common question was “What’s the difference between Computer Science, Software Engineering, and Computer Engineering?” I’ll probably write a post about this in the future when I gain more experiences. For the meanwhile, check out Patrick Lam’s well written responses comparing the three programs. &lt;a href=&quot;https://uwaterloo.ca/software-engineering/future-undergraduate-students/comparing-bse-bcs&quot;&gt;Comparing SE vs. CS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://uwaterloo.ca/software-engineering/future-undergraduate-students/comparing-bse-basc-comp-eng&quot;&gt;Comparing SE vs. CE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also took on other initiatives as an Engineering Ambassador. I gave out three shadow days, where prospective students shadowed me for the entire day. The three students not only learned more about Waterloo, but also had lots of fun! I would highly recommend the &lt;a href=&quot;https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering-student-ambassadors/shadow-program&quot;&gt;Waterloo Engineering Shadow Program&lt;/a&gt; to any prospective Engineering student. In addition, I volunteered at a Waterloo Alumni event at the Oakville Conference Centre. Three other related achievements I was proud of were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;https://yconic.com/discussion/waterloo-engineering-admission-2015/t44500&quot;&gt;‘Waterloo Engineering Admissions’ thread&lt;/a&gt; on the StudentAwards forum became the most viewed post on the STEM sub-forum, receiving over 300 responses and 75,000 views.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Professor Bill Anderson gave my blog &lt;a href=&quot;https://profbillanderson.wordpress.com/2014/10/09/first-month-of-waterloo-engineering-bo-pengs-world/&quot;&gt;a shout out&lt;/a&gt;. This was an incredible feeling because I followed his blog throughout high school. It definitely helped me out with the admissions process.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m now featured on Waterloo’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://uwaterloo.ca/find-out-more/student-life/student-blogs&quot;&gt;first-year blogger website&lt;/a&gt;. Initially, my name was spelled as ‘Po Beng’ which was surprisingly amusing. :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m quite satisfied with what I’ve accomplished as an Engineering Ambassador over the past term, but I know there is always room to improve. One project I would like to take on next term is to organize school field trips to the University of Waterloo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/volunteer-alumni.png&quot; alt=&quot;Volunteer Alumni Event&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;extracurriculars-enactus--engineering-society&quot;&gt;Extracurriculars: Enactus &amp;amp; Engineering Society&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our executive team planned a successful kick-off meeting on November 11th. Check out the photos on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/79155431@N08/sets/72157647155979824/&quot;&gt;Flickr!&lt;/a&gt; We invited our Faculty Advisor, David, our Enactus Canada manager, Julie, Enactus Laurier President, Thomas, and AISEC Waterloo President, Nima to speak. The atmosphere in the room was great and you could instantly tell that the 50+ people who attended were excited! We planned two more meetings after that and have an official team size of 50 members. We’ll be kicking off 2015 with our innovative social projects! We’re looking forward to the National Competition in May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was one of the two EngSoc representatives for my class and had a great time throughout the term. I attended 6 meetings, and many more EngSoc events. It’s absolutely amazing to see how much passion the executives and the other class reps have for the love of Engineering at Waterloo. From charity pancakes to volunteering at the Museum to the semi-formal, there are always fun events planned. Did I mention that there was free food at every single meeting? Another event I particularly enjoyed was the Career Fair that the VP of Education, Josh, organized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/enactus-team-fall-2014.png&quot; alt=&quot;Enactus Team Photo Fall 2014&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;se-hack-day-and-nspire-start-up-competition&quot;&gt;SE Hack Day and Nspire Start-Up Competition&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SE Hack day is an event held every term, where students work on a project for 6-8 hours. My friends and I created a Waterloo Food Menu app, which displays the restaurant locations and times, weekly menus, and even allows you to check your remaining meal plan balance. We didn’t quite finish it; however, it was a really chill night filled with learning and fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also participated in a 24 Hour Start-Up competition which actually spanned the entire weekend, from Friday night to Sunday. My team created an app called “CityKit”. Through the CityKit application, users are connected with relevant events based on their location and time, effortlessly while on-the-go. Our service also empowers economic development within cities all around the world. It provides businesses and entrepreneurs with a simple yet effective platform that showcases their events and products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/nspire-hack.png&quot; alt=&quot;Nspire team&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We thought of this idea after being unaware of a Santa Claus parade occurring in the city. Ultimately, this led in the King Street being blocked out and causing major inconveniences to the traffic. If we had the CityKit app, we would have known about this parade and either arranged alternate travel plans or maybe even attend this festive event. We find that people are often too disconnected with what is occurring in the city, and more focused on what is going on in only their lives. We want people to become urban adventurers and integrate the city into their lives. Admittedly, it’s an ambitious goal, but we’ll see how this goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;academics-and-final-exams&quot;&gt;Academics and Final Exams&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1A was quite an interesting experience in terms of academics. I think I performed at a decent level for the term. I will find out my marks on December 22nd; however, I already know that I was not satisfied with my performance this term. With hindsight, there are so many things that I can improve on. These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Starting assignments the day they’re assigned rather than the day they’re due.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t skip lectures and don’t fall behind.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prepare for midterms and finals in advance, instead of the night before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to admit that I was quite distracted this term and didn’t put in much effort. Next term, I promise I will change my habits and work hard. I know I have what it takes to become an excellent student. I must add that there are many resources for achieving student success such as your Professor’s office hours, practice exams, hardworking classmates, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;funandcoolstuff&quot;&gt;#FunAndCoolStuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meeting the Dean of Engineering, Pearl Sullivan and receiving a Dean’s Ducky&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Watching Velocity Final Fund Pitches&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sarah Sharp presentation&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;The week where I had free dinner every single night&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The span of 4 days where I played ping pong more than I slept (the amount of times I’ve heard random people say: “Hey I saw you playing pingpong at V1”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/deans-ducky.png&quot; alt=&quot;Dean's Ducky&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list goes on and on… To say that I’m having a great time at Waterloo would be an understatement. I am truly having the time of my life. It’s been one heck of a term, and I’m glad it’s finally over. I’m looking forward to spending a nice Winter Break with friends and family. To my classmates and all the friends I’ve made this term, thank you for making my first term such a wonderful experience. To all the professors and TA’s, thank you. To the Software 2018’s, I’m really going to miss you guys. To MC2066 (an extremely hot and uncomfortable lecture room), I cannot say the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’ll end this post with a beautiful picture of the glorious Math and Computing building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>Waterloo Open House Fall 2014</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000///waterloo-open-house-fall-2014/"/>
   <updated>2014-11-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/waterloo-fall-open-house-2014</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;An estimated total of over 11,000 people attended Waterloo’s Fall Open House 2014. This represents a new record, and it just astonishes me how much Waterloo grows every single year. I volunteered for the entire day as the department lead ambassador for Software Engineering, so it’s very likely that I met many of my readers in person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/fall-open-house.png&quot; alt=&quot;fall open house 2014&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember how one year ago, I was the person asking the volunteers questions. Times have changed, and now I’m the  one who answers these questions and share my experience at Waterloo. I really enjoyed meeting so many passionate students and sharing my personal stories with them. Andrew Morton, the director of the Software Engineering program, gave a very informational presentation about our program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the room was always packed and boiling hot, each person learned something new about our program and had their questions addressed. At the end of every presentation, a few upper-year students and I would hold an open question and answer session for the whole crowd. I think having the current students talk about their experiences and answering the questions was a great supplement to the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, thanks to everyone who came out today! The Fall Open House was a huge success!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Halfway Through 1A Waterloo Engineering</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000///halfway-through-1a-waterloo-engineering/"/>
   <updated>2014-11-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/halfway-through-1a-waterloo-engineering</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! Sorry that I haven’t posted anything in the past month. School and life has been extraordinarily busy! Remember when I mentioned how time flies? Well, it’s exactly how my life is right now. It feels as if the beginning of October was just yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the highlights of my second month at Waterloo Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;assignments-labs-and-quizzes&quot;&gt;Assignments, labs and, quizzes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our five core courses, we have weekly assignments, labs, and quizzes. Assignments are either done on paper or through online assessments. Some of them are quite challenging and tricky; however, each one is only worth 1%. Quizzes are written during tutorials and test your understanding of the concepts. They’re usually only worth 1% each as well. As you can tell, assignments and quizzes make up only a small portion of your overall mark. This doesn’t mean you should fool around and not take them seriously. They are important because they test your knowledge and understanding of concepts, before the major midterm and final exams. If you’re doing poorly on them, you should immediately seek help and review your studying habits. Since there’s assignments, labs, and quizzes every single week, it always keep you busy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;midterm-week&quot;&gt;Midterm week&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Tuesday October 14th to Saturday October 18th, I had 5 midterm exams. Thankfully, we didn’t have any classes during this week. I personally thought that the midterms were quite representative of what we learned in class. The questions were all very fair. I don’t want to dwell into too many details, but I learned a lot during midterm week. I will definitely prepare and study harder for the final exams. As long as you maintain a strong work ethic and do the practice midterms, you’ll do well. I’m looking forward to the final exams in December, which is spread over two weeks. Hopefully, I can learn from my past mistakes and improve my final marks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;scribbler-project&quot;&gt;Scribbler Project&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our Software Engineering 101 course, we are required to program a robot to perform certain features. It’s an interesting project; however, it’s super difficult to operate the Scribbler smoothly. There’s so many issues wrong with it such as high dependance on battery level, poor censors, and glitchy motors. My group recently demoed our bot for the Object Avoidance test. It seems like a simple task, but all of the previously mentioned problems makes it a pain to work with. Our next step is to program the Scribbler bot to perform any desired function. Our group’s idea is to make the robot follow different paths and then play the appropriate music notes. We will be using key features such as line following and colour recognition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;engineering-society-events&quot;&gt;Engineering Society Events&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes Waterloo’s Engineering Society so awesome is the fact that they run so many events throughout the year. In October, there were some really fun events such as: Coffee House at Bomber, charity pancakes, hockey night, First Year Mentoring Conference, Middle of Term party, Women in Engineering Yoga, pumpkin carving, all nighters, costume contest, programming workshop, Change4Change, and the list just goes on and on. I would highly recommend everyone to get involved with EngSoc because not only are the events incredibly fun, but you also build upon your soft skills and get to meet new people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;enactus-waterloo&quot;&gt;Enactus Waterloo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh man, running Enactus Waterloo has eaten up so much of my time. I briefly discussed about my involvement with Enactus Waterloo in my previous blog post. Our core executive team met several times and brainstormed about project ideas. Now that I think about it, coming up with a brilliant idea and executing it is quite challenging. We also launched a recruitment campaign for the executive positions. We used social media and word of mouth to spread the news. By the end of the week, we received almost double the number of applications that we had initially expected. I was quite impressed by the applicants’ qualifications, willingness to learn, and most importantly their passion for social entrepreneurship. However, choosing the applicants for an interview was not an easy process. There were so many qualified applicants, but our team can only afford so much time to interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past week, I was at Tim Horton’s interviewing applicants every single day from 6:00pm to 8:00pm, with some additional interviews in the morning and afternoon. I must say it was quite an interesting experience being on the other side of the table. As the interviewer, you really get to know each candidate on a personal level. I particularly enjoyed listening to each applicant’s unique story and their passion for changing the world. There were many tough decisions to make, but I’m glad the stressful selection process is all over (for now).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Waterloo has a co-op program, students typically alternate between school and work terms. This makes choosing the executive team an even trickier decision because people come and go every four months. Therefore, we decided to recruit two sets of alternating executives. We are very happy with our newly selected executives and anticipate it’s going to be one heck of a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s what happened in the month of October. I still can’t believe I’m halfway through my 1A term. To be honest, time is flying way too quickly, I wish I could just slow down the clock. Oh wait, tonight is the end of Daylight savings time, so we’ll have to turn back the clock by an hour. Awesome, I guess my wish just got granted! Anyways, until next time.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>First Month of Waterloo Engineering</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000///first-month-of-waterloo-engineering/"/>
   <updated>2014-10-05T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/first-month-of-waterloo-engineering</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Oh man, it’s October already? Time really does fly in university…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first month in university was incredible. Without a doubt, it was one of the best months of my life. You guys are probably wondering right now: “Bo, what made your month so special?” My response would be: “Everything.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;academics&quot;&gt;Academics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing’s first, we go to university to learn and indulge in the world of academics. I’m studying Software Engineering, one of the most competitive and rigorous programs in Canada. I am taking six courses: linear algebra, calculus, linear circuits, physics, computer science and a Software Engineering course. This approximates to about 30 hours of class each week. I’ve attached my schedule below, and you can see that from Monday-Thursday I have class from 8:30AM-6:00PM. On Friday, it’s only 8:30AM-1:30PM. The blue represent my lectures, tutorials, labs and seminars. The purple represent due dates, office hours, and other miscellaneous events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/engineering-schedule.png&quot; alt=&quot;engineering schedule&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In each course, we either have weekly assignments, quizzes, labs, or a combination of the above. Fortunately, they’re only worth up to 20% of your mark, so doing poorly on one of them won’t kill your mark. They definitely teach you to properly manage your time and prepare you for the big midterm and final exams. As you can imagine, waking up to morning classes every single day is quite tiring. It’s important to get as much sleep as you can, but sometimes it’s quite difficult (unless you have a great work ethic). It’s essential to review your notes and do the assignments to ensure a good understanding of concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I started off the year with a poor work ethic, worrying more about my social life than homework. I have slowly been improving my work ethic and have almost caught up! Falling behind in a course is NOT recommended. My advice is to finish your assignments and work well before they are due. DO NOT start your assignment the night before it’s due. Speaking from my personal experience, it’s a horrible idea. This isn’t high school anymore, where you can breeze through homework and assignments in under an hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In first-year engineering, students have this week called “Hell Week”, where they have an entire week dedicated for midterms. I don’t have any classes during this week, but the thought of having 5 midterm exams in 5 days is quite intimidating. For the next two weeks, I’m going to be working super hard to get the best marks I can. Hopefully, when I blog about my midterms in two weeks from now, I’ll be in a happy mood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;extracurriculars&quot;&gt;Extracurriculars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I LOVE extracurriculars and doing stuff outside of the classroom. Actually, I think I like them a bit too much because they’re eating up a big chunk of my time. In high school, I was involved in this awesome club called “SAGE (Students for the Advancement of Global Entrepreneurship.” Basically, students team up to create and implement entrepreneurial projects that addresses a social problem within the community. Joining SAGE was probably one of the best decisions I made in high school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of my involvement with SAGE, I decided to start and lead an Enactus chapter at Waterloo. The logistics involved with starting a club was quite time consuming, but we are now officially a registered club at the University of Waterloo and are affiliated with Enactus Canada. We managed to find an incredible and experienced Faculty Advisor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of our club is to utilize the power of social entrepreneurship to transform lives and shape a better world. We will create and implement community projects that empower the lives of individuals to improve their standard of living and quality of life. We will present our projects at the Enactus regional and national competitions where we will be evaluated by global leaders and executives serving as judges. Club members will have the opportunity to attend conferences, competitions, and workshops to enhance their professional development. I will start recruiting members and executives after my “Hell Week” ends. Enactus Waterloo is going to be one heck of a ride!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to starting my own club, I’m involved in a bunch of other clubs. I was elected to be the Engineering Society representative of my Software Engineering class. Check out our class’s website. I’ve only attended two meetings so far, but I can confidently say EngSoc meetings are hilarious! I am going to be attending their events on a regular basis and also volunteer for them. In the future, I’m looking forward to obtaining director and executive roles in Engineering Society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also a Waterloo Engineering Ambassador. I would recommend checking out the Waterloo Engineering Shadow Program. You’ll get to experience a day-in-the-life of an Engineering student! I went on two shadow days last year, and it was two great learning experiences. As an Engineering Ambassador now, it feels like a full circle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;social-life&quot;&gt;Social Life&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too many stories. Too many awesome moments. I’m compiling a big list of memorable moments at Waterloo and it’s quite long already. I’ll definitely share some of these moments with you guys later. I just want to make it clear that Waterloo is not anti-social. To be more exact, no place is anti-social, it all depends on the person. Let’s just say that I’ve partied at least once every single weekend and that they’re EPICLY FUN. I would say that my social life is superb right now, and I’m having the time of my life. I’m going to have to sacrifice some aspects of my social life over the next two weeks to focus on exams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sleep&quot;&gt;Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The magic number is 49. How did I get that number? 7 days * 7 hours per day. You should aim for that many hours of sleep each week. Personally, I’m falling a bit under 49 hours/ week of sleep due to academics and social life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fun-fact&quot;&gt;Fun fact.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one week where I got free dinner every single night. How did I pull this off?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Club meetings, employer info sessions, tech talks always have free food!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Hey there everyone! It’s been quite a hectic first two weeks at Waterloo. When I say hectic, I mean THE BEST TIME EVER!!! Although my schedule is packed, I’m going to try my best to write weekly posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s a recap of my first week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday was the first day of class of my university career. I woke up quite late, so I barely made it to class on time. It sort of felt like the first day of high school when I was looking for an open seat. Except this time, I actually knew tons of people in my program beforehand. The professor “Mario” wasted no time in starting the MATH 115 (Linear Algebra for Engineers) lecture. It was really difficult to take notes and maintain focus at the back, so a couple of us went directly to the front and sat down on the ground. Next thing you know, the 50 minute lecture was over. We had an hour break until our next class, so we went to the SLC and chatted with our classmates. My classmates are pretty awesome people and I know I’m going to have a blast with them over the next five years. We’ll have our glorious moments together and also have those times of struggles. However, the one thing I dislike most about my classmates is the fact that we’re all super keeners who line up at the door 20 minutes before the class starts. Don’t expect a good seat if you arrive 10 minutes early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, we had three consecutive lectures: MATH117 (Calculus), ECE105 (Physics), and ECE140 (Linear Circuits). These courses along with CS137 (Computer Science) and SE101 (Software Engineering  Course) seem pretty interesting at first glance — much better than the high school courses we were forced to take. I know I’m going to have to build a strong work ethic in order to thrive in this rigorous program. I’ll write an update post on these 6 courses in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the week was similar to Monday, tons of lectures and academics. I won’t comment too much about them because they’re quite boring!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, my classmates and I discovered the Software Engineering lounge. It’s so cool that it needs a password to get in. The lounge has very comfy couches and even has a refrigerator. Several “softies” chilled in the room and socialized. I recall some of the guys karaokeing to ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’ by Queen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday was special because there was a ‘Super Mega Software Class Get Together.’ There was a student from all 5 current Software classes at Waterloo. To sum up, it was a really nice event to get to know your classmates and upper-year students They provided us with fantastic advice and of course scared us a little bit. The Associate Director of Software Engineering even attended the event. A couple of people actually thought he was a student! With hindsight, I shouldn’t have eaten the whole box of Oreos. (The Freshman Fifteen is real.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday there was Resume Critiques hosted by the Waterloo Engineering Society. I didn’t go because I wasn’t feeling too well and the line was too long. From what I’ve heard, it was a great and very helpful event. I will make sure to attend the next Resume Critique!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hands down, Friday was the best day of the week for numerous reasons. First, Friday is my lightest day with classes from 8:30 to 1:30pm. Second, there was a Software Engineering frisbee game between many 2018 softies and first years. Playing sports, especially team sports, with others is a fantastic way to bond. I’m definitely going to keep in touch with many of the people I played with. Perhaps, another frisbee game in the future? It was difficult to distinguish which player was on which team, so we played a “Skins vs Shirts” game. I was part of the “skins” team. Oh man, it was cold… But I have no regrets, since it was an awesome game!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the game, I took a nice, refreshing shower and got ready for Engineering Society’s Beginning of Term party at POETS. The party wasn’t the type of party I expected, but I still had a great time meeting and talking with other students. Hmm, I wonder if I could list that under my interests for my resume. “I love meeting new people and listening to their stories.” There were plenty of snacks and drinks, which is always a plus for any event. The upper-years who only talked with other upper-years were sprayed with water by EngSoc directors! Finally, the recurring theme of “sense of community” within Software Engineering appeared once again. Every single Software Engineering student I’ve met have all been super incredible and friendly people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to coming here, I had high expectations for Waterloo. So far, this experience at Waterloo has far exceeded my previous expectations. What more can I say? I love Waterloo.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Rain Never Bothered Me Anyway</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000///the-rain-never-bothered-me-anyway/"/>
   <updated>2014-09-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/the-rain-never-bothered-me-anyway</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There’s some things in this world you just can’t control. One of them is &lt;strong&gt;rain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past week, it has rained numerous times in Waterloo. As a result, many orientation events were modified or cancelled. This obviously sucked for all of the enthusiastic froshies like me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOWEVER…. orientation week was still a blast! Everyone kept a positive attitude and looked past the miserable weather. What made the week so fun was the awesome people I met. These people are going to be my future best friends, classmates, co-workers, significant others, or perhaps even future boss!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I’m trying to say is that you should always be an optimistic person and make the most out of unfortunate situations. Always try to maintain a positive attitude and have fun! Check out Shawn Achor’s TED Talk on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLJsdqxnZb0&quot;&gt;Happy Secret to Better Work.&lt;/a&gt; He explains how changing your view of the world and life to a more positive one can increase both your happiness and productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a quote from one of my favourite movies of all time, Rocky Balboa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The world ain’t all sunshine and rainbows. It’s a very mean and nasty place and I don’t care how tough you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain’t about how hard you hit. It’s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That’s how winning is done! Now if you know what you’re worth then go out and get what you’re worth. But ya gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain’t where you wanna be because of him, or her, or anybody! Cowards do that and that ain’t you!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Rocky famously conveys, you should NOT blame others for your problems. Rather than complain about them, you should simply accept that there are matters in life which you can’t control. I, too, have went through difficult times in my life. It took a while for me to realize, but complaining and blaming others doesn’t help. It only makes the situation even worse. What you can and should do is filter the negative things in your life and convert them into motivation. Push yourself to work even harder, and never stop persevering. Remember life WILL get better. By putting yourself in an optimistic state, you’re in a good position to achieve happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Orientation Week at Waterloo</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000///orientation-week-at-waterloo/"/>
   <updated>2014-09-06T00:00:00-04:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Today is day 6 of my Waterloo experience! Here’s a recap of my journey so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 1:&lt;/strong&gt; I moved in to Village One on Sunday. The official move in day for my building was on Monday, so it was just me and another guy for the whole day. Moving in and saying goodbye to my parents was quite bittersweet. I’m going to miss living with them, but I’m also going to enjoy every single moment of this new lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I participated in the scheduled orientation activities: Warrior Welcome and Playfair. Warrior Welcome was decent. It was basically a pep rally event trying to create Waterloo spirit. Playfair was surprisingly really fun. There were about two thousand first year students doing fun activities on the V1 Green. Some activities were really awkward, but that’s what makes it so fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 2:&lt;/strong&gt; My floor mates moved in on Monday (which woke me up urgh). They are really nice people! I’m looking forward to living with them for the next 8 months. Our building had a introduction meeting and played icebreakers to get to know each other. I recall playing a LOT of ping pong on this day. Aside from that, nothing interesting happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Tuesday was the first day of the orientation week activities. Since I’m in Software Engineering, I get to participate in both the Math and Engineering orientation activities. I was part of team Dark-Yellow in Engineering and Meme-Theorem Valley in Math. The day started off at the Dark-Yellow(“dellow”) headquarters. I met a lot of new and fascinating people from my team. The leaders, especially the Software people, were awesome people. Next up was a speech from the Dean of Engineering at Waterloo, Pearl Sullivan. She’s an extraordinary person and definitely embodies Waterloo’s values and culture. Out of nowhere, Edcom pops up and sends a message to all the Frosh. I’m not going to describe edcom because I don’t want to give any spoilers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, the Software kids from my group went to the Math Orientation team. We met up in Davis Centre and did a couple of sub-par activities. They were pretty lame to be honest. Whatever, at least I got the opportunity to meet new people. The day was filled with rain, so the orientation activities for Engineering had to be modified. Regardless, we still got our coveted Yellow Hardhat at the end of the day. During the night, I hung out with friends and checked out  “Choose your own adventure”. There were activities planned such as Haunted House, hypnotist show, drag show, and much more. We had to wait an hour and a half to get in the two minute Haunted House. I would say it’s not worth it, but I loved bonding with the others during the long wait time. Apparently, the hypnotist show was epic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 4:&lt;/strong&gt; All Engineering students had Wednesday off, except the Software kids. I went to the Software Engineering 101 event and then had a department lunch at Mongolian grill. The food was amazing. The people were even more incredible. Then, we participated in various activities to earn our Pink Tie. During the night time, my friends and I participated in World of Waterloo, which was basically a tour of the city of Waterloo. It was decent, but was way too hyped up. Afterwards, a couple of us went to Chatime (never a bad time for Chatime).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 5:&lt;/strong&gt; Thursday was a SUPER FUN day. The 1500+ first-year Engineering students participated in the aerial photo at St. Paul green. I’m excited to see how the picture will turn out. This type of stuff requires so much organization and creativity! Next, the 16 teams battled against each other in the Junkyard Wars. I don’t want to spoil this either, but let’s say a lot of collaboration and quick thinking is required. The highlight of the orientation activities was definitely the “Single and Sexy” play. It exceeded my expectations and made the entire audience go into laughter. Of course, there were also key lessons portrayed. If you’re going to Waterloo next year, you MUST watch this. It’s THAT good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was also the Monte Carlo, which started at 8:00 PM. Most people dressed up in a semi-formal way. I was impressed by how much effort people put into dressing up. The event was hosted at SLC, and was actually fun. There were a bunch of casino games set up. The Texas Hold ‘Em tables were super filled up. What I loved most about the event was the complimentary snacks! I left Monte Carlo early and then went to Frosh Frenzy at Pearl nightclub with my friends. I’m not going to disclose the specific details about Frosh Frenzy because I have a wide audience of people reading my blog. Let’s just say there was a lot of dancing and cheering. It was definitely one of the best nights ever. Well worth the money spent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 6:&lt;/strong&gt; There was a huge thunderstorm in Waterloo Friday morning, with some of the loudest thunder cracks and powerful lightning strikes I’ve ever witnessed. It was reported that a female student from the University of Waterloo was struck by lightning and later passed away in the hospital. It’s such a tragic event.  I’d like to send all of my condolences to the student and her family. This event really got me thinking about life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Safety should always be prioritized.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;You never know when your last day will be so enjoy every single moment. Life is simply too short to be depressed all the time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll conclude this post with an interesting graphic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/orientation-week-graphic.png&quot; alt=&quot;orientation week&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past week, I’ve lived by this quote. I haven’t had much sleep, but who cares? ‘Cause I’m having so much fun, and this is probably the last time in a long time, where I can afford to give up sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>University Application Important Dates</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000///university-application-important-dates/"/>
   <updated>2014-08-31T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/university-application-important-dates</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I start my first day of university tomorrow, I’d like to share with you grade 12’s the process of applying to university. This post will be a brief timeline and will only contain information about Ontario universities. I didn’t apply to Out of Province universities so I’m not knowledgable about that. By the way, I went to a semestered school in Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/ouac.png&quot; alt=&quot;university application&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;timeline&quot;&gt;Timeline&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 2014&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ontario University Fair (OUF): The OUF is running from September 19th to 21st this year at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre. All universities in Ontario will be there! They typically will bring admission officers, recruitment/marketing officers, undergrad students and professors. Make sure you come prepared with questions. If not, don’t worry because they’re all really friendly people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2014&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parent-Teacher night: To be honest, this night isn’t very important. However, by this date, your teachers should provide you with a mark update. If you’re doing well, keep up the good work! Make sure you don’t lose momentum and slack off. If you’re doing “meh”, then this is the time you have to start working even harder. If you’re doing poorly, this is your wake up call. These next few months determine the rest of your life. So why waste this opportunity?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halloween: HAVE FUN! Remember grade 12 is supposed to be the fun year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;University fall open house: These typically run in late October and early November. You can drive to your desired school and check out their campus. This is very useful for checking the culture, both academic and social.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pro tip: If you’re interested in Waterloo Engineering, definitely apply for a shadow day. I participated in one last year and I really enjoyed it. It’s basically a one-on-one tour with a Waterloo Engineering student!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 2014&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semester 1 midterm marks: You’re getting closer and closer to the end of Semester 1 (or midterms for those non-semesters kids). Basically follow the same advice I gave for Parent-Teacher night. This set of marks are NOT reported to Ontario universities. So you have some breathing room, if your marks aren’t what you’d like to them to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OUAC Pins handed out: Around mid-late November (sometimes even early December), your school will hand out your Ontario University Application Centre pins. Now you can start applying to University! YAY! You can browse through your programs and then apply. Applying is very simple. All you have to do is choose your programs and then pay. You have to pay $130 for your first 3 programs, and then additional $44 for each program beyond the initial 3. Note: You must pay $130, even if you apply to one university. You will be able to see all of you grade 11 courses under academic information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;December 2014&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Week before Winter break: For some reason, everyone tends to slack off this time of year. (I did too) Make sure you keep doing your homework and maintain your work ethic, otherwise it’ll cost you a couple of % on your final mark. Just hang in there for a bit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winter break: During the break, I would strongly recommend to work on your supplementary application. Most competitive programs require a supplementary application. Generally, you have to write a few short essay responses and list your extracurricular activities. At Waterloo, if you don’t fill out the AIF, you may not be considered for admission. Make sure when you’re done to have a peer or teacher edit it. The supplementary is important for both admission and scholarship purposes. I will cover this in another post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 2015&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back from break: So you’re back from the break. You have about 3-4 weeks, until semester one is done. Keep on working hard and prepare well for the exams. If it comes down to a shortage of time, focus on your program’s required courses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Super-early admission offers: Some universities will hand out super-early admission offers to students with amazing grade 11 marks (or grade 12 if they fast tracked) in December/January. Don’t be concerned if you don’t receive an offer at this time. Some programs don’t even hand out offers during this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 2015&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supplementary application deadlines: Most apps are due in February, some are due a bit later. Submit them! Don’t wait until the last minute to do them. Please, I can’t stress this enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semester 1 final marks uploaded on OUAC: Your school will report your marks to OUAC and universities will be able to see them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early admission offers: Many programs will hand out offers during late February/early March based on your Semester 1 final marks. They typically hand out a small portion of their offers. For example, Waterloo Engineering only handed out roughly a quarter to a third of their offers during the early round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March 2015&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March open house: Same thing as above, check them out if you’re interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuous round of offers: Some programs hand out continuous offers throughout March and April. Waterloo Engineering does this for out of province students. If you’re an Ontario student, don’t expect an offer during this time span.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 2015&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semester 2 midterm marks: In mid-late April, semester 2 midterm marks will be up on OUAC. By this point, you’ve done all you could to help your cause. Now, your fate is in the hands of the admission officers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 2015&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huge round of offers (“regular admission”): This is pretty much the final and largest round of offers. Universities will hand out the offers they have left. If you received an offer, CONGRATULATIONS! If not, then oh well, you tried your best right? If you still want to get in the program, I suggest you apply to be on the wait list. There’s also another type of offer- alternate offer. If your application was not strong enough for the program you applied to, universities sometimes give you an alternate offer to a less competitive program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prom: Have fun. You’ve waited the whole year for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 2015&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deadline to accept your offer on OUAC: Last year was June 2nd, this year I think it’s June 1st. Accept your offer! It might be hard choosing between two or more programs, but follow your heart. Don’t make anyone else make that decision for you. Speak to your teachers, family, university alumni, and etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apply to OSAP: If you require funding for your studies, definitely apply to OSAP. I might post a detailed guide on this some other day. Listen to me when I say this: don’t procrastinate on this. It might seem like work, but remember, this is money you’re dealing with. I recommend you guys to apply before June 15th. You’ll get funding estimates earlier and if you made a mistake, you can fix it earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintain your conditional offer: All universities hand out conditional offers. This means that you have to keep a specific mark in your pre-req’s and top 6 average, or some variant of this. Usually the conditional averages they require are tens of % below your admission average. However, make sure you don’t cross below the threshold. Your offer may be at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait list: Sometimes, if you’re in the right place at the right time, you can get off the wait list and receive a late offer to your desired university program! Don’t bank on this though. I’m just throwing the idea out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I have covered the basics of the university application timeline. If you prepare well, it won’t be that stressful. Anyways, good luck on your grade 12 year!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s 7:00am and right now I’m in the car leaving off to Waterloo. I will be living in a single room in Village 1. I will cover the topic of residences in a future post!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been preparing myself for move in day for months now. I’m still astonished by how fast semester 2 and the summer went. Of course, there were some moments that went incredibly slow (cramming for Chemistry tests, procrastinating on English essays, preparing for interviews, etc.) I don’t normally get this hyped for an event but this is the university life we’re talking about. My expectations of Waterloo are probably way too high right now. I’m sure it won’t disappoint as long as I make an effort to enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be precise, my official move in day is tomorrow (September 1st) but I requested to move in earlier due to a scheduling conflict. I hope there will be at least one person in my residence today. Nevertheless, I am excited to meet everyone from my floor and building tomorrow. I’ll probably roam around Waterloo tonight and hang out with my friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I’m almost at Waterloo. It’s going to be bittersweet saying goodbye to my parents in a few hours. Oh well, c’est la vie.&lt;/p&gt;
