<h2 id="2017-recap">2017 Recap</h2>

<ul>

  <li>I <a href="why-I-transfered-from-SE-to-CS">transferred from SE to CS</a>. I will now graduate in August 2018, so I will begin job hunting in January or February. (Hello full-time friends who can help me out! üòÑ)</li>
  <li>Made significant <a href="my-gym-transformation">strength and aesthetics progress</a>, including a 405lb deadlift PR!</li>
  <li>Secured a <a href="how-I-got-a-job-at-linkedin-by-using-linkedin">co-op offer at LinkedIn</a>, and the opportunity to return to my favourite place in the world: New York City. üóΩ</li>
  <li>Had a great time at <a href="http://2017.cusec.net/">CUSEC 2017</a> in Montreal.</li>
  <li>An awesome <a href="unforgettable-summer-internship-at-axon">internship at Axon</a>. The summer weather in Seattle is spectacular.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6339532432571797504">Rode along with police officers</a> across the US and watched them use lackluster software solutions.</li>
  <li>Flew to Hollywood and learned about how the industry works there.</li>
  <li>Went on the <a href="axon-grand-canyon-trip-2017">best trip of my life</a> to date. Spent a week rafting and camping along the Colorado River, and then hiked out of the Grand Canyon.</li>
  <li>Discovered how amazing the Bose QC 35 Wireless Headphones were ‚Äì they literally changed my life.</li>

  <li>Turned 21 a few weeks ago, finally legal in America!</li>
</ul>

<p>Oh man, what an incredible year it‚Äôs been. These were just a few of many memories that I loved about 2017.</p>

<p>Back in February, I wrote a blog post about the <a href="below-the-iceberg-surface">iceberg illusion</a>. I was very proud of writing that post because it was the first time I openly discussed struggles that I was facing. In 2018, I wish to write more about challenging moments, so that my blog can be more relatable and personal.</p>

<h2 id="2018-goals">2018 Goals</h2>

<p>A year ago, I had set several <a href="/farewell-2016-hello-2017">goals</a> for my 2017 year. Though I‚Äôm pleased that I achieved most of them, I also realized that some of these goals didn‚Äôt really matter that much to me. For example, one goal that I described was ‚Äú<em>significantly reduce my use of plastic water bottles</em>‚Äù.</p>

<p>For 2018, I‚Äôm setting goals that are much simpler and more meaningful to me.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Be happy and healthy.</li>
  <li>Be brave and vulnerable.</li>
  <li>Maintain &amp; develop great relationships.</li>
  <li>Graduate.</li>
  <li>Get full-time job offer(s).</li>
  <li>Join the 1000lb club for squat/bench/deadlift total.</li>
</ul>

<p>I‚Äôm feeling quite bullish about 2018. I can‚Äôt wait for the new people and experiences 2018 will bring to my life!</p>
