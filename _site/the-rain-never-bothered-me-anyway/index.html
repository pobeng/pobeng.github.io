  <p>There’s some things in this world you just can’t control. One of them is <strong>rain.</strong></p>

<p>Over the past week, it has rained numerous times in Waterloo. As a result, many orientation events were modified or cancelled. This obviously sucked for all of the enthusiastic froshies like me.</p>

<p>HOWEVER…. orientation week was still a blast! Everyone kept a positive attitude and looked past the miserable weather. What made the week so fun was the awesome people I met. These people are going to be my future best friends, classmates, co-workers, significant others, or perhaps even future boss!</p>

<p>What I’m trying to say is that you should always be an optimistic person and make the most out of unfortunate situations. Always try to maintain a positive attitude and have fun! Check out Shawn Achor’s TED Talk on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLJsdqxnZb0">Happy Secret to Better Work.</a> He explains how changing your view of the world and life to a more positive one can increase both your happiness and productivity.</p>

<p>This is a quote from one of my favourite movies of all time, Rocky Balboa.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The world ain’t all sunshine and rainbows. It’s a very mean and nasty place and I don’t care how tough you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain’t about how hard you hit. It’s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That’s how winning is done! Now if you know what you’re worth then go out and get what you’re worth. But ya gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain’t where you wanna be because of him, or her, or anybody! Cowards do that and that ain’t you!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As Rocky famously conveys, you should NOT blame others for your problems. Rather than complain about them, you should simply accept that there are matters in life which you can’t control. I, too, have went through difficult times in my life. It took a while for me to realize, but complaining and blaming others doesn’t help. It only makes the situation even worse. What you can and should do is filter the negative things in your life and convert them into motivation. Push yourself to work even harder, and never stop persevering. Remember life WILL get better. By putting yourself in an optimistic state, you’re in a good position to achieve happiness.</p>
